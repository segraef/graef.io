## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing many industries, including the world of art. I have seen firsthand the incredible potential of artificial intelligence to create stunning and original pieces of art. From computer-generated paintings to AI-generated music, the possibilities are endless. That's why I want to motivate you to explore the world of AI art and create something truly jaw-dropping.

In this blog post, I'll provide you with sweet and exclusive prompts to get started with creating jaw-dropping AI art. Let's dive in and see how you can use your skills and knowledge to create something truly amazing!

## Prerequisites

You need Discord, should already have an account with [www.midjourney.com](https://midjourney.com) and be familiar with how to use `/imagine` prompts.

## Basic Prompt Commands

Let's just get straight to the point, we all know the **Basic ommands**:

- `/imagine` creates an image based on the prompt text you provided. It produces a grid of 4 images, taking around 50 seconds with default settings.
- `/settings` gives you an interactive window to select options.
- `/help` displays universally helpful information and tips about the Midjourney bot.
- `/info` shows information about your profile, plan, usage, and currently running jobs.
- `/subscribe` creates a unique link to the subscription page of your current Discord account, without needing to sign in on the website.

but more important are `/imagine` parameters:

- `--aspect` or `--ar` changes the aspect ratio of a generation (default: `--ar 1:1`)
- `--no` Negative prompting, `--no mushrooms` would try to remove mushrooms from the image.
- `--stylize` or `--s` parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.
- `--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>`, or `--q <.25, .5, 1, or 2>` defines how much rendering quality time you want to spend (default: `1`)
- `--seed <integer between 0â€“4294967295>` When using the MidJourney bot to create AI-generated art, the process begins by generating a field of visual noise, similar to television static, using a seed number. This seed number is randomly generated for each image, but can also be specified using the `--seed` or `--sameseed` parameter. By using the same seed number and prompt for multiple images, you can achieve similar ending images with subtle variations, allowing you to experiment and fine-tune your artistic vision.

More parameters see [Parameters List](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list).

### Multi-Prompts and Prompt Weighting

To employ multi-prompts in Midjourney, insert a double colon (`::`) in between your prompts without any gaps. Multi-prompts are typically employed to modify the behavior of compound words in the prompts.

|cup cake|cup:: cake|
|---|---|
|![](123.png)|![](456.png)|
| *Cup cake* is considered as a single word. | *Cup* and *cake* are considered separate words. |


The double colon `::` is used to divide a prompt into parts. You can put a number after it to show how important that part is. Adding a number to a word is called prompt weighting or text weighting.

|jelly:: fish|jelly::2 fish|
|---|---|
| ![](20230306152531.png)    | ![](20230306152317.png)    |
| *Jelly* and *fish* are considered separate words. | *Jelly* is twice as important as *cake*.|

More details see [Multi Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/multi-prompts)

### Prefer Suffix

Since you know me and everything I do is about to ***Automate everything*** you can and should use a *Suffix*:

- `/prefer` command saves you having to type the options every time that you use the `/imagine` command

I'm usually working with the suffix `/prefer suffix --ar 2:3 --q 2` which always sets my aspect ratio to portrait (`--ar 2:3`) and uses best quality (`--q 2`).

{{< image src="20230302143126.png" caption="">}}

So next time I send a prompt like this
{{< image src="20230307161643.png" caption="`kintsugi glacial ice::2 oil painting, palette knife texture, thick paint, wide brushstrokes, vibrant vivid colors::2 by Iris Scott, Leonid Afremov and Vincent Van Gogh::1`">}}

it adds the suffix `--ar 2:3 --q 2`.

## Aspect Ratios
### 1:1 (Square, default aspect ratio)
{{< image src="20230302160842.png" caption="Prompt: `An atomic color explosion --ar 1:1`" >}}

### 2:3 (Portrait)
{{< image src="20230302152120.png" caption="Prompt: `Professional black and red powder explosion, white background, 8k --ar 2:3`" >}}

### 3:2 (Landscape)
{{< image src="20230302151002.png" caption="Prompt: `watercolor rainbow --ar 3:2`" >}}

### 16:9 (Wallpaper)
{{< image src="20230302203557.png" caption="Prompt: `white porsche, rainbow neon --ar 16:9`" >}}

### 1:2
{{< image src="20230302154728.png" caption="Prompt: `color chaos --ar 1:2`" >}}

### 2:1
{{< image src="20230302153321.png" caption="Prompt: `Beautiful, weird and abstract painting of a dark and colourful landscape by Thomas Kinkade, Greg Rutkowski, Dan Mumford, Dan Witz, Daarken and James Gurney --ar 2:1`" >}}

## Cheat Codes
Okay, enough basics, let's get to the gist and give you some good examples!

> ***Note:*** In some prompts I used multi-prompts as well as weighting to achieve better results.

### "as *this* or *that*"
Let's say you want to have your character/style look like something you have in mind (Disney, Pixar, Superman, ...), just use "`... as Superman`" or "`... as Disney`", or even both.

{{< image src="20230302154833.png" caption="Prompt: `Superman as a Disney character`" >}}

### Glitchart
{{< image src="20230302152931.png" caption="Prompt: `infinity space:: glitchart::1`" >}}

### Nebula vs. Psychedelic
{{< image src="20230303125837.png" caption="Prompt: `fluorescent mushroom:: nebula::1`" >}}
{{< image src="20230303130607.png" caption="Prompt: `fluorescent mushroom:: psychedelic::1`" >}}

### Double Exposure
{{< image src="20230303131245.png" caption="Prompt: `beautiful woman, vibrant colours and firework, double exposure`" >}}

### Generate new images based on your own images
`/imagine https://link-to-your-image.jpg <your prompt>`
