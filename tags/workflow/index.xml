Keeping these repositories up to date—especially when working with multiple engineering teams—can be a daunting task. That’s where automation comes in.</p>
<p>To simplify this, I’ve developed a consolidated PowerShell script that combines the functionality of my previous scripts into one:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/segraef/Scripts/blob/main/PowerShell/Update-Repos.ps1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Update-Repos.ps1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This script helps automate the process of cloning and updating repositories, making it significantly easier to manage a large number of repos efficiently.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Create your own official Azure Pipelines Agent Images and GitHub Actions Runner Images</title><link>https://graef.io/create-your-own-official-azure-pipeline-agents-images-and-github-actions-runner-images/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:06:10 +1000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://graef.io/create-your-own-official-azure-pipeline-agents-images-and-github-actions-runner-images/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s create your own Azure Pipelines Agent Images or GitHub Actions Runner Images based on the official <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">source code</a> used for <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">GitHub-hosted runners</a> used for Actions, as well as for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops#use-a-microsoft-hosted-agent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Microsoft-hosted agents</a> used for Azure Pipelines.

Microsoft announced a new ARM DSL, called Bicep. I won’t go into too much detail here, as I’m more into how to use a GitHub Action to use Bicep to generate an ARM template out of a .bice file. But let me give you some context to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Azure/bicep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Bicep&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Azure Github Actions and Workflows</title><link>https://graef.io/azure-github-actions-and-workflows/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 17:52:07 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://graef.io/azure-github-actions-and-workflows/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let me give you an introduction how to use the power of GitHub Actions and Workflows to deploy resources into Azure. I’m going to explain you the basics of GitHub Actions, Workflows, runners and how to deploy resources into Azure. At the end of this post you should have understood how GitHub Actions and Workflows work together to give you a kickstart to run your own.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
