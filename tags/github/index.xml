That’s exactly what happened when I assigned an issue to GitHub Copilot coding agent. From identifying the problem to drafting a pull request and running checks, it handled the entire workflow, efficiently and autonomously. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it turned a routine fix into a hands-free solution that saved me hours.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automating Repository Management in Github and Azure Devops With Powershell</title><link>https://graef.io/automating-repository-management-in-github-and-azure-devops-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 10:22:10 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://graef.io/automating-repository-management-in-github-and-azure-devops-with-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;p>Working in large enterprise environments often means managing a complex landscape of repositories across multiple GitHub organizations and Azure DevOps projects. Keeping these repositories up to date—especially when working with multiple engineering teams—can be a daunting task. That’s where automation comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To simplify this, I’ve developed a consolidated PowerShell script that combines the functionality of my previous scripts into one:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/segraef/Scripts/blob/main/PowerShell/Update-Repos.ps1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Update-Repos.ps1&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This script helps automate the process of cloning and updating repositories, making it significantly easier to manage a large number of repos efficiently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mastering DevOps: Your Guide to Learning, Certification, and Community Engagement</title><link>https://graef.io/devops-basics-studying-learning-and-skilling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 15:43:57 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://graef.io/devops-basics-studying-learning-and-skilling/</guid><description>&lt;p>DevOps is not just a set of tools but a cultural shift towards automation, collaboration, and integration between software development and IT operations.
