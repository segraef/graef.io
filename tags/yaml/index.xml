Microsoft announced a new ARM DSL, called Bicep. I won’t go into too much detail here, as I’m more into how to use a GitHub Action to use Bicep to generate an ARM template out of a .bice file. But let me give you some context to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Azure/bicep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer"&gt;Bicep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Azure Github Actions and Workflows</title><link>https://graef.io/azure-github-actions-and-workflows/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 17:52:07 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://graef.io/azure-github-actions-and-workflows/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an introduction how to use the power of GitHub Actions and Workflows to deploy resources into Azure. I’m going to explain you the basics of GitHub Actions, Workflows, runners and how to deploy resources into Azure. At the end of this post you should have understood how GitHub Actions and Workflows work together to give you a kickstart to run your own.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
