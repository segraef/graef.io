2. **Wide Accessibility**: OpenAI’s tools are available to the public through APIs, with various subscription options catering to different needs.
3. **Research and Safety**: OpenAI prioritizes research into AI safety, ensuring the technology is developed responsibly and ethically.

## Microsoft Azure OpenAI

[Microsoft Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) combines OpenAI's powerful models with Microsoft’s robust cloud infrastructure. Available exclusively to Microsoft Enterprise customers, Azure OpenAI offers a suite of [AI capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/cognitive-services#categories-of-azure-cognitive-services) tailored for enterprise use.

### Key Features of Microsoft Azure OpenAI

1. **Custom Models**: Azure OpenAI allows for the customization of [AI models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) to meet specific business needs and requirements.
2. **Text Prompt Processing**: Fine-tuned AI models are designed to handle specific tasks efficiently, ensuring high performance.
3. **Ethical AI Usage**: Azure OpenAI includes features for prompt examination to ensure [ethical use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/legal/cognitive-services/openai/overview?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), monitoring, and preventing misuse of AI technologies.
4. **Seamless Integration**: Azure OpenAI integrates seamlessly with other [Azure services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/cognitive-services), providing businesses with a cohesive and powerful suite of tools.

## Key Differences and Feature Matrix

- **Ownership and Operation**: While OpenAI operates independently, Azure OpenAI is a collaborative effort between Microsoft and OpenAI, combining strengths from both organizations.
- **Access and Availability**: OpenAI’s models are publicly accessible with flexible subscription options. In contrast, Azure OpenAI is available exclusively to Microsoft Enterprise customers and requires an [Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview#how-do-i-get-access-to-azure-openai).
- **Support and Integration**: Azure OpenAI offers integration with [Azure Cognitive Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/cognitive-services) and comprehensive support for enterprise users. OpenAI provides customer support through various channels for its public API users.
- **Training Data Usage**: Azure OpenAI uses customer data strictly for [custom model development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/ai-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart) and does not use it for broader model improvements. OpenAI used training data for model improvements prior to March 2023.
- **Regional Availability**: Azure OpenAI is available in specific regions, aligning with Azure’s data center locations, while OpenAI’s services are accessible globally.

{{< admonition info Important >}}

Your prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs), your embeddings, and your training data using Azure OpenAI:

- are NOT available to other customers.
- are NOT available to OpenAI.
- are NOT used to improve OpenAI models.
- are NOT used to improve any Microsoft or 3rd party products or services.
- are NOT used for automatically improving Azure OpenAI models for your use in your resource (The models are stateless, unless you explicitly fine-tune models with your training data).
- Your fine-tuned Azure OpenAI models are available exclusively for your use.

The Azure OpenAI Service is fully controlled by Microsoft; Microsoft hosts the OpenAI models in Microsoft’s Azure environment and the Service does NOT interact with any services operated by OpenAI (e.g. ChatGPT, or the OpenAI API).
