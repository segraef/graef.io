Originally developed to provide low-cost computers to schools, they are expanding far beyond their intended use. This inexpensive technology can be used to accomplish previously unexplored tasks. One such technology is a cluster computer that can run parallel jobs. Many systems built for parallel computing tasks are either expensive or unavailable outside of academia. Supercomputers are expensive to purchase as well as to use, power, and maintain. Although average desktop computers have come down in price, the cost can still become quite high if they require a larger amount of computing power. In today's world of information technology (IT), it is not new to be confronted daily with new technologies such as cloud computing, cluster computing or high-performance computing. All these terms are approaches that are intended to simplify people's work and lives. Cloud providers such as Microsoft or Amazon make these types of technologies available to customers in the form of services for a fee. Users thus have the opportunity to use the computing power of these technologies without having to buy them at a high price. The advantage here is the almost unlimited scaling of resources. Distributed computing, an infrastructure technology and basis for the provision of cluster computers via the Internet, is used to meet increasing resource demands. By interconnecting and adding remote systems, computing power and performance can be dynamically scaled and provided in theoretically unlimited quantities.

Expensive supercomputers are oversized when it comes to testing new applications for high-performance computers or solving complex problems. In this work, we address the question of whether we can create an independent and comparable but also less expensive system with few resources, which allows us to solve complex problems in the same way. 24 years ago, Donald Becker and Thomas Sterling started the Beowulf project to create a low-cost alternative but also a powerful alternative to supercomputers. Based on this example, the idea has arisen to pursue the same principle on a smaller scale. The goal of this work is to create an affordable, energy efficient and portable mini-supercomputer. Ideally, a cluster computer with little or no carbon footprint, individual elements that are inexpensive to replace, and a portable system that can be easily disassembled and reassembled. A Raspberry Pi is ideal for this purpose because of its low price, low power consumption, and small size. At the same time, it still offers decent performance, especially when you consider the computing power offered per watt.

Amdahl's and Gustafson's law At the beginning of this work, the theoretically unlimited increase of computing power was mentioned. Amdahl's law (named in 1967 after Gene Amdahl) deals exactly with this question, namely whether an unlimited increase in speed can be achieved with an increasing number of processors. It describes, how the parallelization of a software affects the acceleration of this. One divides thereby the software into not parallel, thus sequentially executable and parallel executable portions. Sequential parts are process initializations, communication and the memory management. These parts are necessary for the synchronization of the parallel parts. They form dependencies among themselves and are therefore not able to be executed in parallel. Parallel executable parts are the processors, which are used for computation. It is very important to estimate how much performance gain is achieved by adding a certain number of processing units in parallel working system. Sometimes it happens that adding a larger number of computing units does not necessarily improve the performance, because the expected performance tends to decrease or oversaturate if we blindly add more computing resources. Therefore, it is very important to have a rough estimate of the optimized number of resources to use. Suppose a hypothetical system has only one processor with a normalized runtime of $1$. Now we consider how much time the program needs in the parallelizable portion and denote this portion by $P$. The runtime of the sequential part is thus $(1 - P)$. The runtime of the sequential part does not change, but the parallelizable part is optimally distributed to all processors and therefore runs N times as fast. This results in the following runtime formula: 1 $$\\underset{\\text{sequential}}{\\overset{(1 - P)}{︸}} + \\underset{\\text{parallel}}{\\overset{\\frac{P}{N}}{︸}}$$ This is where the time gain comes from: $$Time\\ gain\\ according\\ to\\ Amdahl$$ $$= \\ \\frac{original\\ duration}{\\text{new\\ duration}}$$ $$= \\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \\frac{P}{N}}$$ Here N is the number of processors and P the runtime portion of the parallelizable program. Gene Amdahl called the time or also speed gain Speedup. With the help of a massive parallelism the time of the parallelizable portion can be reduced arbitrarily, the sequential portion remains unaffected thereby however. As the number of processors increases, the communication overhead between the processors also increases, so that above a certain number, they tend to be busy communicating rather than processing the problem. This reduces the performance and refers to this as an overhead in the task distribution. A program cannot be completely parallelized, so that all processors are always busy with work at the same time. No matter how many processor units are used and the proportion of applications that cannot be parallelized is, for example, one percent, the speedup can be a maximum of 100. Gene Amdahl thus concluded that it makes no sense to keep increasing the computing units in order to generate unlimited computing power. 2 Amdahl's model remains valid until the total number of computing operations remains the same while the number of computing units continues to increase. However, if in our hypothetical simulation the job size increases while the number of computational units continues to increase, then Gustafson's law must be invoked. John Gustafson established this law in 1988, which states that as long as the problem being addressed is large enough it can be efficiently parallelized. Unlike Amdahl, Gustafson shows that massive parallelization is nevertheless worthwhile. A parallel system cannot become","date":"Monday, Aug 9, 2021","objectID":"/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/:4:1","tags":["thesis","raspberry","pi"],"title":"Conception, Construction and Evaluation of a Raspberry Pi Cluster","uri":"/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/"},{"categories":["Projects"],"content":"Cluster A cluster is a computer network and usually refers to a group of at least 2-n servers, also called nodes. All nodes are connected to each other via a local area network (LAN) and form a logical unit of a supercomputer. Gregory Pfister defines a cluster as follows: 22 \"A cluster is a type of parallel system that consists of interconnected whole computers and is used as a single, unified resource. “ 23 Clusters are the approach to achieving high performance, high reliability, or high throughput by using a collection of interconnected computer systems. Depending on the type of setup, either all nodes are active at the same time to increase computing power, or at least 1-n node is passive so that it can stand in for a failed node in case of failure. For data transmission, all servers are connected to each other via at least two network connections to a network switch. Two network connections are typical, since on the one hand the switch is excluded as SPOF, and on the other hand to be able to realize a higher data transfer. 24 With reference to the current Top 500 list of the world's fastest computers, the term supercomputer is absolutely appropriate. It is clear that several cluster systems are among the ten fastest computers in the world. Computer clusters are used for three different tasks: providing high availability, high performance computing and load balancing. 25 Shared and distributed storage According to the von Neumann architecture, a computer has a shared memory that contains both computer program instructions and data. Parallel computers are divided into two variants in this respect, systems with shared or distributed memory. Regardless of which variant is used, all processors must always be able to exchange data and instructions with each other. The memory access takes place via a so-called interconnect, a connection network for the transfer of data and commands. The interconnect in clusters is an important component for exchanging and communicating data between management and load distribution processes. 26 In systems with shared memory, all processors share a memory. The memory is divided into fixed memory modules that form a uniform address space that can be accessed by all processors. The von Neumann bottleneck comes into play here, which means that the interconnect, in this case the data and instruction bus, becomes the bottleneck between memory and processor. Due to the sequential or step-by-step processing of program instructions, only as many actions can be performed as the bus is capable of. As soon as the speed of the bus is significantly lower than the speed of the processors, the processors repeatedly have to wait. In practice, the waiting time is circumvented by the use of buffer memories (cache), which is located between the processor and the memory. This ensures that program commands are available to the processor quickly and directly. 27 Source: Own representation based on (Bauke \u0026 Mertens, 2006, p. 22); Cf.

Figure 7 shows the representation of memory (M) and processors (P) connected via the interconnect. Computer systems with distributed memory, on the other hand, have a separate memory for each processor. In this case, a connection network is required. As soon as a shared memory is dispensed with, the number of processors can be increased without any problems. By using a distributed memory, each processor gains the upper hand over its address space, since it is allocated its own local memory. Similar to distributed memory, communication takes place via an interconnect, which in this case is a local network.

This foundational technology is necessary for the operation of container technologies like Docker. In computer science, virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual, rather than actual, version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage device, or network resources. Virtualization refers to a technology in which an application or an entire operating system is abstracted from the actual underlying hardware. In connection with container technologies, a well-known type of virtualization, we distinguish here between two techniques of virtualization, hypervisor-based and container-based virtualization. 39 Hypervisor-based virtualization A key application of virtualization technology is server virtualization, which uses a software layer called a hypervisor to emulate hardware such as memory, CPU, and networking. The guest OS, which normally interacts with real hardware, implements this with a software emulation of that hardware, and often the guest OS has no idea it is running on virtualized hardware. The hypervisor decides which guest OS gets how much memory, processor time and other resources from the host machine. In this case, the host machine runs the host OS and the hypervisor. This means each OS appears to have direct access to the processor and memory, but the hypervisor actually controls the host processor and resources by allocating what is needed by each OS. While the performance of this virtual machine does not match the performance of the OS running on real hardware, the concept of hypervisor-based virtualization works quite well because most OSes and applications do not require full use of the underlying hardware. This allows for greater flexibility, control and isolation by eliminating dependency on a specific hardware platform. Originally intended for server virtualization, the concept of virtualization has expanded to applications, which is implemented using isolated containers. 40 Container-based virtualization Container virtualization or container-based virtualization is a method of virtualizing applications but also entire operating systems. Containers in this sense are isolated partitions that are integrated into the kernel of a host machine. In these isolated partitions, multiple instances of applications can run without the need for an OS. This means that the OS is virtualized, while the containers that run inside the system have processes that have their own identity and are thus isolated from another process in another container. Software running in containers communicates directly with the host kernel and must be executable on the operating system and CPU architecture on which the host is running. By not emulating hardware and booting a complete operating system, containers can be started in a few milliseconds and are more efficient than traditional virtual machines. Container images are typically smaller than virtual machine images because container images do not need to contain device drivers or a core to run an operating system. Because of the compactness of these application containers, they find their predominant use in software development. Developers do not have to set up their development machines by hand; instead, they use pre-built container images. These images are memory maps of entire application structures that can be arbitrarily moved back and forth between different host machines, also called shipping. This is one of the reasons why container-based virtualization has become increasingly popular in recent years. 41 Examples of container platforms are Docker from Docker Inc. and rkt from the developers of the CoreOS operating system, with Docker enjoying increasing popularity in recent years. Compared to virtual machines, Docker represents a simplified solution to virtualization. 42 Figure 14 shows the key differen","date":"Monday, Aug 9, 2021","objectID":"/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/:4:3","tags":["thesis","raspberry","pi"],"title":"Conception, Construction and Evaluation of a Raspberry Pi Cluster","uri":"/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/"},{"categories":["Projects"],"content":"Container Management Systems As soon as several containers are to be distributed and run on a parallel system such as a cluster, it is necessary to use a container management system. Such a system manages, scales and automates the deployment of application containers. Well-known open source systems are Kubernetes from Google or Docker Swarm. Another very well-known container manager worth mentioning is the OpenShift software from Redhat, but we will not discuss it further in this paper. These cluster management tools play an important role as soon as a cluster has to take care of tasks such as load balancing and scaling. In the following, we will introduce the first two container managers mentioned and explain their structure and use with containers. Docker Swarm Docker is an open standards platform for developing, packaging, and running portable distributed applications. With Docker, developers and system administrators can create, deliver, and run applications on any platform, such as a PC, the cloud, or a virtual machine. Obtaining all the necessary dependencies for a software application, including code, runtime libraries, and system tools and libraries, is often a challenge when developing and running an application. Docker simplifies application development and execution by consolidating all the required software for an application, including dependencies, into a single software unit called a Docker image that can run on any platform and environment. The Docker software, based on the Docker image runs in an isolated environment called a Docker container, which contains its own file system and environment variables. Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the underlying operating system. 43 One solution already integrated into Docker is Docker Swarm Mode. Docker Swarm is a cluster manager for Docker containers. Swarm allows administrators and developers to set up and manage a cluster consisting of multiple Docker nodes as a single virtual system. Swarm mode is based on Docker Engine, the layer between the operating system and container images. Clustering is an important feature for container technology because it creates a cooperative group of systems that provides redundancy and enables failover when one or more nodes experience a failure. A Docker Swarm Cluster provides users and developers the ability to add or remove containers as compute requirements change. A user or administrator controls a swarm through a swarm manager, which orchestrates and deploys containers. Figure15 shows the schematic structure and relationship between instances. 44 Figure x: Description y\" Figure x: Description y Source: Own representation based on Figure 15: Structure and communication of the manager and worker instances. The Swarm Manager allows a user to create a primary manager instance and multiple replica instances in case the primary instance fails, similar to an active/passive cluster. In Docker Engine's swarm mode, the user can provision so-called master nodes and worker nodes at runtime. 45 Google Kubernetes The name Kubernetes comes from the Greek and means helmsman or pilot. Kubernetes is known in specialist circles by the acronym K8s. K8s is an acronym where the eight letters \"ubernete\" are replaced by \"8\". Kubernetes provides a platform for scaling, automatically deploying and managing container applications on distributed machines. It is an orchestration tool and supports container tools such as Apache Mesos, Packer, and including Docker. 46 A Kubernetes system consists of master and worker nodes, the same system principle as Docker Engine, with manager instances named master. The smallest unit in a Kubernetes cluster is a pod and runs in the worker nodes. This pod consists of at least one or more containers. A worker node can in turn run multiple pods. A pod is a worker process that shares virtual resources such as network and volume among its containers. 47 Source: Own representation based on (Pods and Nodes","date":"Monday, Aug 9, 2021","objectID":"/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/:4:4","tags":["thesis","raspberry","pi"],"title":"Conception, Construction and Evaluation of a Raspberry Pi Cluster","uri":"/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/"},{"categories":["Projects"],"content":"Raspberry Pi Credit-card-sized single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi, developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, were originally intended to promote computer science education in schools. Acronyms like \"RPi\" or the abbreviation \"RasPi\" or \"Pi\" for the Raspberry Pi are mostly common here. Like smartphones, single-board computers are equipped with ARM processors (Advanced RISC Machines). Before the development of ARM in 1983, there were mainly CISC and RISC processors on the market. CISC stands for Complex Instruction Set Computer. Processors with this architecture are characterized by extremely complex instruction sets. Processors with RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architectures, on the other hand, have a restricted instruction set and therefore also operate with low power requirements. The Pi's board is equipped with a system-on-a-chip (SoC, i.e. single-chip system), which has the identifier BCM2837 from Broadcom. The SoC consists of a 1.2 GHz ARM Cortex-A53 Quad Core CPU, a VideoCore IV GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and 512 MB of RAM. It does not include a built-in hard drive, but uses an SD card for booting and permanent data storage. It has an Ethernet port based on the RJ45 standard for connecting to a network, an HDMI port for connecting to a monitor or TV, USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports for connecting a keyboard and mouse, and a 3.5 mm jack for audio and video output. 50 Source: Own representation based on (Merkert, 2017, p. 12) Figure 17: Illustration of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and its components.\" Source: Own representation based on (Merkert, 2017, p. 12) Figure 17: Illustration of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and its components.

Energy efficiency. Scalability. Resilience. Further criteria are a visual and easy-to-read status and information display of current system values, ideal cooling and optimization of the airflow for the best possible removal of heat. Furthermore, the entire design concept is fundamentally based on certain design requirements, which we will discuss in more detail in the design decisions (see 3.2). Cost and energy efficiency The factors of cost and energy efficiency are paramount and predominantly influence the conception and design. In order to keep the acquisition costs as low as possible but still be able to offer efficient computing power, Raspberry Pi single-board computers in version 3 are to be installed. The use of unnecessary cable lengths or heavy and expensive materials such as sheet steel or aluminum for the housing should be avoided. In addition, a weight and further cost saving is to be achieved by using plastic instead of steel screws. The system should be reproducible at low cost and consume as little power as possible. Energy consumption of less than 60 kilowatts per hour is planned, which is comparatively equivalent to the average power consumption of a commercially available light source such as an incandescent lamp. Such low power consumption implies the portability factor, which means that it should also be possible to use this cluster on a mobile basis. Scaling and resilience Scaling is to be considered in this system in two respects. On the one hand, the user should be given the option of connecting the entire system with other clusters in order to be able to scale cluster-wise at this level. Here we also speak of horizontal scaling. On the other hand, it should be possible to scale vertically or node by node within a cluster by adding or removing individual nodes. This is done either automatically using cluster software or by physically adding or removing further single-board computers. Due to the modular structure of the cluster, the primary goal is to expand individual entire clusters, i.e. vertical scaling. In parallel to scaling, failover is an important player when it comes to keeping the cluster alive. As soon as the cluster system scales on the software side, all peripheral components must be designed and optimized accordingly so as not to reach their physical limits, such as maximum storage capacity or computing power. This also applies to components such as the network distributor and the power supply unit. With the help of organizational measures and the creation of technical redundancies, this fail-safety is to be guaranteed. This is also referred to as system availability. Status and information display For a direct perception of current system values such as host name, system time, processor and case temperature, a visual information display should be available in the form of a display. These important and system-critical values should be immediately and directly readable without the help of technical means, such as a keyboard or the connection of an external monitor. Furthermore, this display should have a backlight to be readable even in dark rooms or with little to no light. Cooling Passive cooling and optimized case ventilation are important points that have to be considered in the design. The advantage of passive cooling should be used to save energy on the one hand and costs on the other. Active cooling is nevertheless necessary to ensure the supply of cold air and the removal of warm air. Likewise, a basic law of physics, the so-called chimney effect, must not be lost sight of during further planning. This states: warm air rises, cold air remains on the ground.

Minimalism in architecture, be it in building or model construction, is characterized by the reduction to simple cubic forms. The goal is the formation of geometric and pure forms, which is made possible with the help of transparent building materials such as glass. Whereupon we come to the property transparency. On the software side, transparency means that the user of this system knows exactly how the cluster system works, how it scales or what software is used. On the hardware side, it is clear which physical components such as cables, network distributors or connectors are connected to each other or whether systems emit visual signals. Simplicity, on the other hand, stands for easy understanding of the system. It should, at first glance, imply the usefulness of this system, from the point of view of an ignorant as well as affine user. Minimalism and transparency: cube We decide on a compact and portable design in the form of a cube and christen the system with the name PiCube. The Pi, as in Rasperry Pi, stands for Python Interpreter and signals that this system supports the Python programming language or is generally supported by all common operating systems like Raspbian or CoreOS. Python convinces with its minimalistic and easily understandable programming style and also contributes to the overall concept of this system. The English word Cube means cube. Another idea for the naming is PiKube, where Kube stands for the cluster management system used and at the same time comes from Kubus, the ancient Greek kybos or the Latin cubus for cube. However, since the design of the cube case does not have exactly equal faces, we decide to use PiCube, since a cube is a regular hexahedron. A hexahedron has six faces of equal size. Simplicity: Elastic Clip Concept In order to allow easy assembly and reassembly, without the use of additional tools or fastening screws of any kind, the Elastic Clip concept by Patrick Fenner was used. This concept allows to create a slim and elegant design. For this purpose, we use acrylic glass, which is transparent, light and flexible, as the construction material for the housing. The clips give the possibility to connect the single acrylic glass sides of the cube in a 90 degree angle. The real highlight here is the automatic snap-in of the clip connections in the insertion openings provided for this purpose. Removal or dismantling of the cube walls is done by bending the clip, so that the connections can be released. 53 Source: Own representation based on (Laser-Cut Elastic-Clips, 2017) Figure 19: Illustration of clip dimensions with and without force application.\" Source: Own representation based on (Laser-Cut Elastic-Clips, 2017) Figure 19: Illustration of clip dimensions with and without force application. $F$ stands for the force applied to the clip. The clip dimensions are: $a$ = 4mm, $b$ = 2m, $d$ = 2mm, $l$ = 25mm Depending on the nature, flexibility and material of the acrylic glass used, the clip may break if too much force is applied. The problem is that the maximum force is applied to the upper right $F$ on the upper right end of the clip, which will break if it is too short. $l$ the clip breaks if it is bent too much or subjected to too much load. To counteract this, there is a simple way to distribute the load on the clip at maximum force by widening the cut. This reduces the risk of the clip breaking. 54 Source: Own representation based on (Laser-Cut Elastic-Clips, 2017) Figure 20: Widening the incision site increases durability.\" Source: Own representation based on (Laser-Cut Elastic-Clips, 2017) Figure 20: Widening the incision site increases durability.

A 3D model helps to better visualize and represent the housing to be constructed. Physical components can be inserted, rotated or scaled in size. Due to the exact specification of the dimensions of the individual components, a correspondingly realistic model is created before it is manufactured.

The acrylic glass plates are milled in collaboration with Andreas Gregori from MAD Modelle Architektur Design. For the production of the case we do not use laser cutting, but normal milling. This has the advantage that we avoid traces of smoke or sclerosis, which occur during laser cutting due to high temperatures. Milling has another advantage and that is the possibility of surface milling. Thus, we are able to engrave the PiCube logo (see Figure 21 and 24) into the upper and front cube surface. The five Raspberry Pis and the matching 8 GB SD cards make up the largest part of the costs, amounting to 246.75 Euros. The middle part of the costs, which ranges between 13.75 and 22.99 Euros, is taken up by the Gigabit switch, the USB charger and the USB cables. The rest of the hardware, such as the LCD display, cables and plastic screws, are in the price range of 0.65 to 9.80 Euros.

To do this, start with the base plate, onto which the left and right side plates are clipped and clipped together. Before assembling the front panel, we wire the individual components. LCD displays only work by being powered and controlled. A total of 4 cable jumpers are used for this purpose. Two of them are for power and the other two are for control and transmission signals which we connect to GPIO pins 2, 3, 5 and 6 of one of the Raspberry Pis which acts as a master node. All mini computers are connected to the switch using RJ45 network cables. Likewise, we connect the cables of the network jacks to the switch, which serve as network port extensions. Micro-USB cables are typically used for data transfer, in this scenario they are only used for powering the individual single-board computers. We connect the network switch and all Raspberry Pis to the USB charger using the USB cables. We connect the case fan with its 3-pin connector to the GPIO ports 2 and 6 of one of the Raspberry Pis to supply it with power.

The OS provides a Docker-optimized Linux kernel and is therefore ideally suited for this cluster. It already includes all the required modules such as Docker Engine, Docker Machine and Docker Compose. HypriotOS is an operating system specially developed for Raspbery Pi, which is based on the Linux distribution Debian. Important prerequisites for the successful operation of a cluster system are identical and redundantly designed hardware (see 2.2) and the cluster software that can run on it. Among other things, this concerns the same software and driver versions for all participating nodes. To ensure that the cluster system maintains a homogeneous operating system and version structure on all nodes, we use operating system images. 56 Imaging and provisioning For the installation of Raspberry Pi operating systems, memory images are used. Images are disk images in a compressed file that contains files, file system structures, and boot sectors. Simply put, an image contains an exact disk copy of an operating system. The advantage of using images is that an operating system does not have to be installed. In order for this exact disk copy to be deployed in our nodes, we copy the contents to SD cards and deploy them in our cluster nodes. Using the Hypriot flash tool, the hostname is passed to the image and is thus hardcoded for the first boot of the Raspberry Pi. Hardcoded means that values, such as the hostname in this case, are passed into the startup configuration of the operating system and are called and used when the system starts. The following code snippet (see Listing1) shows the command that sets the hostname rpi1 for the image package hypriotos-rpi1-v1.6.0.img.zip after downloading the HypriotOS image from the address https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/releases/download/v1.6.0/. 57 flash \\--hostname rpi1 https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/releases/download/v1.6.0/hypriotos-rpi-v1.6.0.img.zip Listing 1: The HypriotOS image is downloaded and copied to the SD card using flash. YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) is a markup language and gives us the possibility to create customized parameters for a startup configuration. Thus, it is very easy to pass values into a configuration which will be initialized and applied when each node is started for the first time. Examples for start parameters, which can be preconfigured: Hostname WLAN -SSID WLAN password Static or dynamic IPaddress The YAML files for our nodes look like this, with the hostname for the respective Raspberry Pi adjusted accordingly: hostname: \"rpi\" wifi: interfaces: wlan0: ssid: \"WLAN\" password: \"2345251344834395\" Listing 2: Example of a YAML configuration. Fixed WLAN parameters lets individual nodes connect to an existing wireless network. We copy this configuration to the image in the /boot/ directory. The following code snippet shows setting the YAML configuration using flash. This accesses /boot/device-init.yaml on initial startup and copies the appropriate parameters to the operating system's startup configuration: flash \\--config https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/releases/download/v1.6.0/hypriotos-rpi-v1.6.0.img.zip Listing 3: The HypriotOS image is downloaded, copied to the SD card using flash and a given YAML configuration. Time is precious and, in order to save it, we prepare the respective image for each individual Raspberry Pi and thus take advantage of the automatic provisioning. Due to the use of a total of 5 cluster nodes, the manual installation, configuration and maintenance of each individual node would be very time-consuming. Therefore, we provision every single operating system in advance, which means we use a master image that already contains current driver versions and software packages.

The connection to the individual Raspberry Pis is established via Secure Shell (SSH). In order to establish this secure connection over the network, the terminal program putty is used. As soon as the connection is established, a \"sudo update\" is performed to update the current package installation lists to the latest version. Afterwards, \"sudo upgrade\" is used to update all the correspondingly required software packages for Docker. The next step is to install Kubernetes using the following command: curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add - \u0026\u0026 echo \"deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get update -q \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get install -qy kubeadm Listing 4: Command to install Kubernetes.

Enabled autoscaling scales pods according to their required resources up to a specified limit. In the following example, we test the autoscaling of our cluster using a simple web application and verify the automatic scalability of the system: 59 For this purpose, a Docker image based on a simple web server application is used. This Docker image contains a single web page, which causes a maximum CPU load by simulated users when called. The Docker image is launched, causing a web server to run with the corresponding web page as a pod. Kubernetes' autoscaler is enabled with the following configuration: 60 KUBE_AUTOSCALER_MIN_NODES = 1: The minimum number of nodes to be used is one. KUBE_AUTOSCALER_MAX_NODES = 4: The maximum number of nodes to be used is four. The fifth node thus retains the function as master. KUBE_ENABLE_CLUSTER_AUTOSCALER = true: Activation of the autoscaler. The pod with the web server container is started with the following properties: CPU-PERCENT = 50: This configuration value specifies the value that is maintained to keep all pods at an average CPU load of 50 percent. As soon as a pod requires more than half of its available computing power, another pod instance is automatically replicated or an exact copy of the running pod is created. MIN = 1: At least one Pod is used for scaling. MAX = 10: A maximum of ten replicas of a pod can be used for scaling. After the pod is started and user load is simulated, an increase in CPU load to 250 percent is observed and that seven pods have already been swapped out or scaled: $ kubectl get hpa NAME REFERENCE TARGET CURRENT MINPODS MAXPODS AGE php-apache deployment/php-apache/scale 50% 250% 1 10 2m $ kubectl get deployment php-apache NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE php-apache 7 7 3 4m $ kubectl get pods NAME RUNNING STATUS AVAILABLE AGE php-apache-3046963998-3ewo6 0/1 Pending 0 1m php-apache-3046963998-8m03k 1/1 Running 0 1m php-apache-3046963998-ddpgp 1/1 Running 0 5m php-apache-3046963998-lrik6 1/1 Running 0 1m php-apache-3046963998-nj465 0/1 Pending 0 1m php-apache-3046963998-tmwg1 1/1 Running 0 1m php-apache-3046963998-xkbw1 0/1 Pending 0 1m Listing 5: Observing CPU utilization increase to 250% while pods are swapped out to provide resources. Two minutes after the user load simulation stops, the CPU utilization drops back to zero and the drop from seven to one pod can be seen. $ kubectl get hpa NAME REFERENCE TARGET CURRENT MINPODS MAXPODS AGE php-apache deployment/php-apache/scale 50% 0% 1 10 7m $ kubectl get deployment php-apache NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE php-apache 1 1 1 9m $ kubectl get pods NAME RUNNING STATUS AVAILABLE AGE php-apache-3046963998-ddpgp 1/1 Running 0 9m Listing 6: Watching CPU utilization drop to zero percent and drop to one pod. As can be seen (see Listing 1), it is very easy to dynamically adjust the number of pods to the load, by enabling the cluster autoscaler. Automatic and dynamic scaling can also be very helpful when there are irregularities in cluster utilization. For example, development-related clusters or continuous computing operations can be run on weekends or at night. Compute-intensive applications can be better scheduled so that a cluster is optimally utilized. In all cases, the cluster can be used optimally. Either reduce the number of unused nodes to save energy or scale to the limit to provide enough computing power. Depending on which case occurs, a dynamically scaling cluster ensures that at high or low utilization, all tasks are solved in the most efficient way.

Setting the number to five physical nodes per enclosure is one reason for creating the possibility of optimal scaling and appropriate resilience. The greater the number of nodes, the less likely there is to be a total failure or bottleneck in scaling capabilities. Load balancing and availability are closely related to cluster resilience. One way to ensure that a master node is highly available is to allow a worker node to step in as master. Kubernetes already inherently brings the function that as soon as a master node fails, a worker takes its place. The active/passive design is already in use. Second, this failover implementation is active for all worker nodes. Figure 28 shows how load balancing and failover work together to keep this cluster alive in the event of a master as well as worker node failure. The actors here are the cluster components etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller and kube-scheduler (see 2.4.2). The Kubernetes API server, controller, and scheduler all run inside Kubernetes as pods. This means that in the event of a failure, each of these pods will be moved to a different node, thus preserving the core services of the cluster. Here, one considers potential failure scenarios: Loss of the master node: If not configured for HA, loss of the master node or its services will have a severe impact on the application. The cluster will not be able to respond to commands or deploy nodes. Each service in the master node is critical and is configured appropriately for HA, so a worker node automatically steps in as the master. Loss of worker nodes: Kubernetes is able to automatically detect and repair pods. Depending on how the services are balanced, there may be an impact on the end users of the application. If any pods on a node are not responding, kubelet detects this and informs the master to use a different pod. Network failure: The master and worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster can become unreachable due to network failures. In some cases, they are treated as node failures. In this case, other nodes are used accordingly to replace the respective node that is unreachable. Source: Own representation. Figure 30: Failure and takeoverscenario of the master node rpi1 and the worker node rpi3.\" Source: Own representation. Figure 30: Failure and takeoverscenario of the master node rpi1 and the worker node rpi3. Kubernetes is configured to be highly available to tolerate the failure of one or more master nodes and up to four worker nodes. This is critical for running development or production environments in Kubernetes. An odd number of nodes is chosen so that it is possible to keep the cluster alive even with only one node. A cluster node can continue to operate in the last instance once a node is only acting as a master and worker. In this state, the cluster is neither highly available, fail-safe, nor completely resilient, but it survives.

With the total acquisition costs, minus the contributed effort to assemble, install and configure the cluster, the value of the investment is exactly 358.79 Euros. This construct is contrasted with a simple Linux cluster for comparison. This Linux cluster consists of commercially available PCs with comparable core data to that of the Raspberry Pi nodes. If we now compare the core data, we can see that the comparison system is definitely associated with higher acquisition costs. It is important to mention that this comparison primarily focuses on the costs and not the performance of the individual systems. It is obvious that a Linux PC, based on a CISC processor architecture, definitely achieves higher FLOPS than an ordinary ARM processor. Nevertheless, it becomes clear in the first approach that, despite the lower performance, there is a significant difference in terms of cost. Especially when performance per watt is calculated. Due to the compact design of the Raspberry Pi and the accommodation of all components, such as the integrated power supply and GPU, it is a competitive partner for the Linux PC. In relation to the costs, the question arises how the comparison systems perform in terms of performance. For this, a performance test is performed with the help of sysbench. Sysbench is a benchmark application that quickly gives an impression of the system performance. For this purpose, a CPU benchmark is run on both systems, which calculates all prime numbers up to 20000, and the results are shown in Table 3 and Figure31.

The average power consumption is about 2 watts in idle mode. The switch consumes 2.4 watts at 0.2 amps of current and 12 volts. The total wattage output of the USB charger is made up of all components and sits at the end of the power chain. Summarizing with all installed components, you get a total power consumption of 13.75 watts in idle and 34 watts at maximum load (see Table4). In the following test, CPU load is generated using the Sysbench prime calculation program and advantages and disadvantages are shown by using active cooling and passive cooling elements. We read system values such as temperature, clock frequency and voltage using the following commands in each case: 61 vcgencmd measure_temp vcgencmd scaling_cur_freq vcgencmd measure_volts core Listing 7: Commands for querying temperature, clock frequency and voltage. In the following, we look at three temperature curves in the case. The CPU clock frequency is 1.2 GHz and the CPU voltage is 1.325 volts over a period of 5 minutes: Temp1: In case, without heatsink on SoC, without active cooling. Temp2: In case, with heatsink on SoC, without active cooling. Temp3: In case, with heatsink on SoC, with active cooling. Next, we look at three temperature profiles of a Raspberry Pi processor. The CPU clock frequency is 1.2 GHz and the CPU voltage is 1.325 volts over a period of 10 minutes: Temp1: CPU, without heat sink on SoC, without active cooling. Temp2: CPU, with heat sink on SoC, without active cooling. Temp3: CPU, with heat sink on SoC, with active cooling. The heat development of the circuit boards of each individual computer is also taken into account. Although this is low, it increases constantly with the number of nodes installed in the case. The heat development is about 35 degrees Celsius with an average load of a single board. With 5 nodes, this is already around 38 degrees, which corresponds to a factor of around 1.08 per node. If all 5 nodes are overclocked by increasing the processor's clock frequency, this factor increases to 1.1. Temperature differences of 10 degrees in the case and the processor prove that the maximum performance of all hardware nodes cannot be exploited without appropriate cooling. Passive heat sinks and an already implemented active cooling with the help of a case fan can help here. There is no question that the optimized airflow inside the case also contributes to the improved cooling performance.

A current PRC project of BOINC is SETI@home, a scientific experiment run by the University of California at Berkeley that uses computers connected to the Internet in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. One participates by running a free client program on a computer that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data. This project relies on the concept of grid computing. Data sets to be processed are divided into smaller data sets and distributed to all participating clients, who compute and communicate the results to the distributor, which reassembles the computations into an overall data set. The current computing power of the entire BOINC grid is 20600 PetaFLOPS, distributed over nearly 0.9 million computers. SETI@home has a share of about 19.1% of this. 62 In the following, container virtualization is exploited and pre-built BOINC client images of Docker are used. These images are prefabricated containers, which are started as scalable pods on the PiCube and scale automatically in order to utilize the entire computing power of the cluster. To do this, you register with the SETI@home project and create an account. Using this account data, you generate a container application called k8s-boinc-demo and start it on the cluster with a scaling limit of 10 pod instances. In Figure32, you can see from the Kubernetes dashboard how the pods are distributed evenly or according to workload across worker nodes rpi2 to rpi5 after launch. 63 Source: Own representation.

It is obvious that the performance of an ARM processor cannot currently keep up with commercially available CISC processors, as described in 5.3. However, the use case and illustration of dynamic scaling show that once distributed systems are interconnected, they develop very high parallel computing power. The Raspberry Pi cluster provides an interesting approach to perform tests or use cases in research, education, and academia. ARM architectures are evolving rapidly in terms of performance and efficiency over the next few years, with power consumption always in mind. The requirements set at the beginning of this thesis, such as energy efficiency, resilience and modularity, have been met and sensibly implemented in the construct. There is no question that this PiCube cluster is not a real competitor to massively parallelized supercomputers, but the decisive approach lies in the benefit of a computing grid. There are several ways to use this system in the future. On the one hand, its simplicity means it can be used for cluster computing to provide a small, full-featured, low-cost, energy-efficient development platform. This includes understanding its limitations in terms of performance, usability and maintainability. On the other hand, it can act as a mobile and self-sufficient \"cloud in a box\" system by adding components such as solar cells and mobile connectivity. Either way, it will remain a fascinating project that offers developers many possibilities and gives a \"think-out-of-the-box\" approach.

Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extented Markdown syntax of LoveIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Once a script was being run on a VM the common output of the Custom Script Extensions looks like this: You can grab this output of your CustomScriptExtension on your VM with the help of that: $output = Get-AzureRmVMDiagnosticsExtension -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -VMName $vmName -Name \"Get-LocalAccountMemberships\" -Status $output = $output.SubStatuses[0].Message $output -replace '\\\\n','' | Out-File output.xml -Force $output = Import-Clixml output.xml The trick here is to get the output message from your CustomScriptExtension with $output.SubStatuses[0].Message, removing every \\n, save it and import it as a readable xml structure. Once digested and imported with Import-Clixml you get the same output as before. So why are we doing it this way? Consider that, you’re going to execute a Custom Script Extension on your VM without having remote access to it, yes you don’t have access to it BUT you know you can use the Azure VMAgent which is by default installed on every VM in Azure. With having a Custom Script Extension executed including any of your script, e.g. “Get-LocalAccountMemberships” you can grab details from your machine without accessing it at all.

If a Cluster Core Resource like File Share Witness or Disk Quorum is in a failing state and offline, the cluster runs into jeopardy and will fail once the active node gets rebooted as no vote can be set to the quorum. To avoid this you should decrease the value of time your cluster core resource attempts to restart. The lower the value the higher the amount of retries your resource has to restart itself. To increase restart attempts for the Cluster Core Resource you need to adjust the “Response to resource failure” policy from one hour to 15 minutes. So with a given period for restarts of 15 minutes, maximum restarts in the specified period of 1 and “If all the restart attempts fail, begin restarting again after the specified period of period” of 15 minutes.
