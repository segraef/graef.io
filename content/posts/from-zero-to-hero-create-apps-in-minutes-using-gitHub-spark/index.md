## GitHub Spark: Personal Micro Apps Powered by AI

GitHub Spark is an experimental project from GitHub Next that reimagines how individuals can create and share personalized software tools—without writing code. At its core, Spark enables users to build "micro apps" (called sparks) tailored to their unique workflows and preferences, using natural language and AI.

## Key Features:
- Natural Language Editor: Describe and refine your app ideas conversationally.
- Managed Runtime: Sparks run in a fully-hosted environment with built-in access to storage, theming, and LLMs.
- PWA Dashboard: Launch and manage sparks from desktop or mobile, with no installation required.

Users can share sparks with others, offering read-only or read-write access, and recipients can remix them to suit their own needs—making personalization collaborative and fun.

GitHub Spark aims to make software as customizable as your dev environment, lowering the barrier to building niche, short-lived, or highly specific tools that would otherwise be deprioritized1.
