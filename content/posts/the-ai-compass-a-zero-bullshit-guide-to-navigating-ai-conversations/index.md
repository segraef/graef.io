“AI isn’t about ChatGPT, just as mathematics isn’t about calculators.”
{{< /admonition >}}

<!--more-->

Everyone throws “AI” into conversations—like it’s a single shiny object. Most of the time, they’re pointing at ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot. Truth is: those are just **corners** of a massive landscape.

If you want to sound credible (or at least not get fooled by buzzwords), you need a baseline framework. Something you can apply in any conversation, whether you’re talking to a CTO, your uncle, or a startup founder pitching their “AI-powered idea.”

This is that framework.

## 1. Levels: Where Are We Really?

AI comes in levels. Knowing which one we’re talking about is step one.

- **Narrow AI (ANI)** – This is what exists. Think:
  - **ChatGPT** → text generation.
  - **Spotify’s recommendation engine** → serving you more lo-fi beats.
  - **Fraud detection models in banking** → flagging dodgy transactions.
  Narrow means “good at one thing, useless outside it.”

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** – Human-level flexibility. It doesn’t exist. Period. Anyone selling you AGI in 2025 is either lying or dreaming.

- **Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI)** – The hypothetical “smarter than us in every way” scenario. Fun for late-night discussions, not practical for product roadmaps.

{{< admonition info Action >}}
Reality check: **everything in the wild today is ANI.** If someone says otherwise, push back.

## 2. Behavior: How Does It Actually Operate?

This is about the system’s “memory” and adaptability. Examples help here:

- **Reactive Machines** – Pure stimulus-response. Example: **Deep Blue (chess engine)**. It calculates moves, no context of the past.
- **Limited Memory** – Learns from past data. Example: **Tesla’s autopilot** → it remembers lane markings, adjusts over time.
- **Theory of Mind** – Hypothetical. If an AI could *really* understand emotions and beliefs, imagine a virtual therapist who picks up subtle sarcasm or lies. Not here yet.
- **Self-aware AI** – Consciousness in a machine. Still science fiction.

{{< admonition info Action >}}
99% of today’s systems are **limited memory**. They learn patterns, but they don’t “understand” the world.

## 3. Method: What’s Under the Hood?

Strip away the marketing—what’s actually powering the system?

- **Symbolic AI** – Rule-based. Old but still around.
  - Example: **Tax calculation engines** → deterministic, zero learning.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** – Pattern recognition from data.
  - Example: **Email spam filter** trained on labeled “spam vs. not spam.”
- **Deep Learning** – Multi-layered neural networks.
  - Example: **Image recognition** in your iPhone → knows it’s your face.
- **Generative AI** – Builds new stuff.
  - Example: **DALL·E** for art, **ChatGPT** for text.
- **Blended Approaches** – Hybrids.
  - Example: **Healthcare diagnostics** combining deep learning (image scans) + symbolic rules (legal compliance).

{{< admonition info Action >}}
Ask: is this thing based on **rules, pattern learning, or creative generation**? That cuts through 90% of the marketing BS.

## 4. Function: What Problem Is It Solving?

Capabilities break down like this:

- **Perception** → Vision, audio, sensor input.
  - Example: **CCTV with object detection**.
- **Prediction & Learning** → Forecasting, classification.
  - Example: **Weather models** or **credit scoring**.
- **Reasoning & Decision-making** → Expert systems.
  - Example: **Route optimization for delivery trucks**.
- **Natural Language** → Chat, summarization, translation.
  - Example: **ChatGPT** answering questions.
- **Action / Control** → Robotics, physical world tasks.
  - Example: **Boston Dynamics robots** lifting boxes.
- **Creativity / Generation** → Content creation.
  - Example: **Runway AI** for video editing.

The function tells you **what it can do**. Without this, “AI” is just a label.

---

## 5. Sector: Where Is It Being Used?

AI isn’t a product. It’s a tool that lives inside industries:

- **Healthcare** – Detecting tumors on scans. Generating new drug candidates.
- **Finance** – Fraud detection, algorithmic trading.
- **Retail & Marketing** – Recommendation engines (Amazon). Targeted ads (Facebook).
- **Manufacturing** – Predictive maintenance on machines.
- **Transport** – Autonomous driving, logistics optimization.
- **Creative industries** – Generative design, music, text.
- **Government / Defense** – Drones, intelligence analysis.

Example: A hospital AI system might be **Narrow AI + Limited Memory + Deep Learning + Perception function + Healthcare sector**. Nice, neat, and clear.

## 6. Conversation Copattern

When someone says “We’re using AI,” don’t let them off the hook. Pin it down:

**“Okay—are we talking Narrow or General? Reactive or memory-based? Rules, ML, or deep learning? What’s the actual function? And in which sector is it applied?”**

Example breakdown:
- **ChatGPT** = Narrow AI + Limited Memory + Deep Learning + Natural Language + Creative/Education sector.

Suddenly the word “AI” has precision instead of hype.

## 7. The Missing Pieces Most People Ignore

This is where you separate signal from noise:

- **Data Quality** – Garbage in, garbage out.
- **Compute Demands** – Running GPT-class models isn’t free—it burns serious GPU hours.
- **Explainability** – Deep learning is a black box; regulators hate that.
- **Ethics & Governance** – Bias, privacy, misuse. If you’re not asking about this, you’re missing the elephant in the room.
- **Human-in-the-loop** – Most systems still need human oversight to avoid catastrophic errors.
- **Integration Cost** – The hardest part is never the model. It’s wiring it into real workflows.

Example: A retail chatbot isn’t just “AI.” It’s **Narrow AI + Deep Learning + NLP**… plus integrations with CRM, compliance checks, escalation rules, and user experience design. That last mile is where projects live or die.

## Bottom Line Cheat-Sheet

AI = [Level] + [Behavior] + [Method] + [Function] + [Sector] + (Missing factors)

So next time someone waves their hands and says, “Our product is powered by AI,” you’ve got the ammo to cut through the fluff and pin down exactly what that means.
