Originally developed to provide low-cost computers to schools, they are expanding far beyond their intended use. This inexpensive technology can be used to accomplish previously unexplored tasks. One such technology is a cluster computer that can run parallel jobs. Many systems built for parallel computing tasks are either expensive or unavailable outside of academia. Supercomputers are expensive to purchase as well as to use, power, and maintain.</description></item></channel></rss>
