Ideally, a cluster computer with little or no carbon footprint, individual elements that are inexpensive to replace, and a portable system that can be easily disassembled and reassembled.</p><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Raspberry Pis are revolutionizing the computer industry. Originally developed to provide low-cost computers to schools, they are expanding far beyond their intended use. This inexpensive technology can be used to accomplish previously unexplored tasks. One such technology is a cluster computer that can run parallel jobs. Many systems built for parallel computing tasks are either expensive or unavailable outside of academia. Supercomputers are expensive to purchase as well as to use, power, and maintain. Although average desktop computers have come down in price, the cost can still become quite high if they require a larger amount of computing power. In today's world of information technology (IT), it is not new to be confronted daily with new technologies such as cloud computing, cluster computing or high-performance computing. All these terms are approaches that are intended to simplify people's work and lives. Cloud providers such as Microsoft or Amazon make these types of technologies available to customers in the form of services for a fee. Users thus have the opportunity to use the computing power of these technologies without having to buy them at a high price. The advantage here is the almost unlimited scaling of resources. Distributed computing, an infrastructure technology and basis for the provision of cluster computers via the Internet, is used to meet increasing resource demands. By interconnecting and adding remote systems, computing power and performance can be dynamically scaled and provided in theoretically unlimited quantities.</p><h2 id=motivation-and-objective-of-the-work>Motivation and objective of the work</h2><p>Unlimited computing power implies the solution approach to be able to solve seemingly unsolvable and complex problems, such as the simulation of black holes or the calculation of the Milky Way. Expensive supercomputers are oversized when it comes to testing new applications for high-performance computers or solving complex problems. In this work, we address the question of whether we can create an independent and comparable but also less expensive system with few resources, which allows us to solve complex problems in the same way. 24 years ago, Donald Becker and Thomas Sterling started the Beowulf project to create a low-cost alternative but also a powerful alternative to supercomputers. Based on this example, the idea has arisen to pursue the same principle on a smaller scale. The goal of this work is to create an affordable, energy efficient and portable mini-supercomputer. Ideally, a cluster computer with little or no carbon footprint, individual elements that are inexpensive to replace, and a portable system that can be easily disassembled and reassembled. A Raspberry Pi is ideal for this purpose because of its low price, low power consumption, and small size. At the same time, it still offers decent performance, especially when you consider the computing power offered per watt.</p><h2 id=procedure>Procedure</h2><p>This paper is divided into 5 parts. The first part is dedicated to the terminological clarification of background information on all technologies involved and how they are related to the cluster. Based on this, the second part clarifies the conceptualization, design, and requirements placed on the system. The main part deals with the construction of the Raspberry Pi cluster and thus forms the practical component, in which design decisions are illustrated and the construction is explained. Following this, important factors such as scalability, performance, cost and energy efficiency are discussed and evaluated. Different use cases are addressed and the technical possibilities are considered. Finally, evaluated evaluations are summarized, limitations are pointed out and future extensions are presented.</p><h2 id=background>Background</h2><p>This chapter covers the basic technologies that form the basis of parallel and distributed systems. These technologies build on each other, as in a layer system, and are dependent on each other. Architectures and techniques based on this, such as virtualization or cluster computing, in turn provide the basic framework for container virtualization and its management systems.</p><h3 id=parallel-and-distributed-systems>Parallel and distributed systems</h3><p>Until computers evolved into distributed computing systems, there have been fundamental changes in various computing technologies over the past decades, which we will briefly discuss in order to make the basic framework of parallel and distributed systems more understandable.</p><h4 id=amdahls-and-gustafsons-law>Amdahl's and Gustafson's law</h4><p>At the beginning of this work, the theoretically unlimited increase of computing power was mentioned. Amdahl's law (named in 1967 after Gene Amdahl) deals exactly with this question, namely whether an unlimited increase in speed can be achieved with an increasing number of processors. It describes, how the parallelization of a software affects the acceleration of this. One divides thereby the software into not parallel, thus sequentially executable and parallel executable portions. Sequential parts are process initializations, communication and the memory management. These parts are necessary for the synchronization of the parallel parts. They form dependencies among themselves and are therefore not able to be executed in parallel. Parallel executable parts are the processors, which are used for computation. It is very important to estimate how much performance gain is achieved by adding a certain number of processing units in parallel working system. Sometimes it happens that adding a larger number of computing units does not necessarily improve the performance, because the expected performance tends to decrease or oversaturate if we blindly add more computing resources. Therefore, it is very important to have a rough estimate of the optimized number of resources to use. Suppose a hypothetical system has only one processor with a normalized runtime of $1$. Now we consider how much time the program needs in the parallelizable portion and denote this portion by $P$. The runtime of the sequential part is thus $(1 - P)$.</p><p>The runtime of the sequential part does not change, but the parallelizable part is optimally distributed to all processors and therefore runs N times as fast. This results in the following runtime formula: <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>$$\underset{\text{sequential}}{\overset{(1 - P)}{︸}} + \underset{\text{parallel}}{\overset{\frac{P}{N}}{︸}}$$</p><p>This is where the time gain comes from:</p><p>$$Time\ gain\ according\ to\ Amdahl$$
$$= \ \frac{original\ duration}{\text{new\ duration}}$$
$$= \frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{N}}$$</p><p>Here N is the number of processors and P the runtime portion of the parallelizable program. Gene Amdahl called the time or also speed gain Speedup. With the help of a massive parallelism the time of the parallelizable portion can be reduced arbitrarily, the sequential portion remains unaffected thereby however. As the number of processors increases, the communication overhead between the processors also increases, so that above a certain number, they tend to be busy communicating rather than processing the problem. This reduces the performance and refers to this as an overhead in the task distribution. A program cannot be completely parallelized, so that all processors are always busy with work at the same time. No matter how many processor units are used and the proportion of applications that cannot be parallelized is, for example, one percent, the speedup can be a maximum of 100. Gene Amdahl thus concluded that it makes no sense to keep increasing the computing units in order to generate unlimited computing
power. <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><p>Amdahl's model remains valid until the total number of computing operations remains the same while the number of computing units continues to increase. However, if in our hypothetical simulation the job size increases while the number of computational units continues to increase, then Gustafson's law must be invoked. John Gustafson established this law in 1988, which states that as long as the problem being addressed is large enough it can be efficiently parallelized. Unlike Amdahl, Gustafson shows that massive parallelization is nevertheless worthwhile. A parallel system cannot become arbitrarily fast, but it can solve arbitrarily large problems in the same amount of
time. <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><h4 id=client-server-model>Client-server model</h4><p>Client-server models are the basic techniques for operating distributed systems. They describe the principle of how tasks and services, such as sending e-mail or providing web applications, are distributed within a network. The corresponding service is centralized on a specific computer, called a server, and the other machines (clients) can use this service. <sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image226.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image226.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image226.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Schill & Springer, 2007, p. 31)  Figure 1: Illustration of the client-server model.</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=media/image226.png data-srcset="/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image226.png, media/image226.png 1.5x, /conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image226.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image226.png></a><figcaption class=image-caption>Source: Own representation based on (Schill & Springer, 2007, p. 31)<br><strong>Figure 1</strong>: <em>Illustration of the client-server model.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Operating systems (OS) such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Windows Server use the above concept and thus provide a client-server system. This is done by establishing the connection to the server on the client side and providing access to services and resources on the server side. Within these operating systems servers are simple programs, which are usually started automatically and run passively in the background. In the Linux environment these programs are called "daemon", under Windows Server they are called "service". In practice, however, different types of these server services are usually encountered. Examples of this are: <sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p><ul><li><strong>Mail server</strong>: Communication service for electronic mail (e-mail).</li><li><strong>Web server</strong>: Transmitting web pages to clients.</li><li><strong>File server</strong>: A file server makes files available on a network.</li></ul><h4 id=peer-to-peer>Peer-to-peer</h4><p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are the opposite of client-server systems. In client-server networks, a server is not necessarily a specific computer. Server and client are referred to as roles in this context, since a computer can also act as a server and a client at the same time. In a P2P system, this distribution of roles does not exist; all computers have equal rights. A computer in a network is a peer because it can be a client and a server at the same time. It can both use and provide services. The functionality, the provision of a service, is therefore provided decentrally in a P2P system. <sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image37.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image37.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image37.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Schill & Springer, 2007, p. 31)  Figure 2: Illustration of the peer-to-peer model.</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=media/image37.png data-srcset="/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image37.png, media/image37.png 1.5x, /conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image37.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image37.png></a><figcaption class=image-caption>Source: Own representation based on (Schill & Springer, 2007, p. 31)<br><strong>Figure 2</strong>: <em>Illustration of the peer-to-peer model.</em></figcaption></figure><p>In contrast to the client-server concept, parallel and distributed systems are not based on P2P systems, but they have been part of the development process of grid and distributed computing and are therefore worth mentioning. <sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup></p><h4 id=grid-computing>Grid Computing</h4><p>The volume of data records in databases is increasing and will continue to increase in the coming years. Cluster systems (see <a href=#cluster rel>Cluster</a>) were developed to handle the complex processing involved and have since become established. However, the demand for computing power and storage capacity is becoming ever greater, especially in scientific areas such as medicine and research or in commercial areas such as e-commerce or financial management. Due to global networking of scientific working methods and international cooperation, more and more information technologies and infrastructures are being interconnected to create collaborative working environments. <sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup></p><p>Grid computing is a distributed computing technique that aims to connect loosely coupled computers and clusters and combine the computing power of all distributed resources into a virtual supercomputer. The basis for integrating these location-independent, cross-institutional, and autonomous resources is the use of existing network infrastructures such as the Internet. The major advantage over cluster systems is the aggregation and sharing of resources such as computers or databases across geographical boundaries. <sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup></p><p>Grid computing can be divided into the following classifications:</p><ul><li><strong>Computing Grid</strong>: access to distributed computing resources.</li><li><strong>Data Grid</strong>: Access to distributed data volumes and storage capacity.</li><li><strong>Service Grid</strong>: Access to distributed applications and services.</li></ul><p>A computing grid is comparable to a power grid. For the consumer, everything that happens behind a socket is hidden, but he can conveniently use the power offered, the electricity. A computing grid is similar in comparison, it connects to the computing network and uses the computing power offered. High costs or lack of financial resources pose solving complex problems as a difficulty for scientific and economic institutions. But due to the possibility like, the bundling of resources of different organizations, it is possible to solve computationally intensive problems cost-efficiently. <sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup></p><h4 id=public-resource-computing>Public Resource Computing</h4><p>As an analogous counterpart to grid computing, public resource computing (PRC) and volunteer computing have emerged to harness hidden computing power using distributed computing.</p><p>The idea and background of this type of distributed computing are that the use of supercomputers is very cost-intensive, on the other hand processors of many computers, such as those of personal computers (PC), servers or smartphones are not fully utilized. Many users work on their PCs with programs that use only part of the total processor power. To make these unused computing resources usable, a corresponding software client is installed on the respective PCs or servers, which establishes the connection to a computing grid, takes over task distribution and makes unused computing power available. <sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup></p><p>The software platform Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) enables the use of this unused computing power of thousands of computers.

Tanenbaum, is a collection of independent computers that appear to their users as a single unified system. Distributed computing resource processing deals with the coordination of these distributed computers. In contrast to cluster systems, most computers have different hardware and operating systems. In some cases, resources and programming languages vary greatly. The basic requirement for these machines to work together and exchange data is that they are connected via a network. <sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup></p><p>The computing technologies mentioned so far fall under the umbrella term distributed computing. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows how these technologies are classified collectively into distributed computing and, among others, into client-server computing and peer-to-peer.</p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image5.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image5.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image5.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Bengel, Baun, Kunze, & Stucky, 2008, p. 4).

The following prerequisites must be observed to prevent problems: <sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup></p><ul><li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: Concurrency in the execution of programs must be ensured. As soon as services and applications are executed in a network of computers, this usually happens at different times and independently of other computers. To ensure this concurrency of applications, it must be possible to scale the system, which means that additional computers can be added to the network as the demand for resources increases.</li><li><strong>Time synchronization</strong>: As soon as systems act together, messages must be exchanged so that appropriate coordination is possible. Messages such as "System A is performing this action" and "System B is performing this action". For proper coordination of these messages, timestamps are needed to enable proper sequencing of these messages within the distributed system. One method of synchronizing system time is to synchronize with external atomic clocks outside of distributed systems or to use a shared time server that uses the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a standard protocol for synchronizing clocks on the Internet.</li><li><strong>Partial failure</strong>: Any system, no matter how well secured, can fail, even if it has an availability of 99.9%. The probability of a failure is still 0.1%, which is already a very large amount for a high number of systems. Care must therefore be taken to ensure that there is no single point of failure (SPOF), the failure of which would result in the failure of the entire system. Other prerequisites, especially in terms of security, that must be taken into account are the use of firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs). As soon as sensitive data and information are transferred from services on the Internet via distributed resources, these can fall victim to network attacks. Without appropriate security mechanisms, information can be stolen or even falsified. With the help of firewalls, only certain resources can be granted access by means of defined security policies. Using a VPN, entire segments of distributed systems can be isolated and compartmentalized by encrypting the entire network data transmission. <sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup></li></ul><h4 id=cloud-computing>Cloud computing</h4><p>Cloud computing is used as a term to represent this vision of computing as a service. A cloud is defined as a set of Internet-based application and computing services so that local data storage and application software can be largely or completely dispensed with. From a technical perspective, cloud computing describes the approach of making IT infrastructures, such as physical or virtual hardware, available via a computer network without the user or cloud user having to install anything on their own computer. Cloud providers such as Microsoft or Amazon make these types of technologies available to customers in the form of services for a fee. Users thus have the option of using the computing power of these technologies without having to buy them at a high price. By providing and managing the cloud infrastructure through the provider, the overall costs are reduced and optimized to a minimum.</p><p>The main advantages of using cloud computing are the almost unlimited scaling of resources, such as computing units or storage capacities. If, for example, a user wants to use a very large quantity of cloud services, it is only a question of cost. The higher a service scales, the higher the costs borne by the customer. <sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup></p><p>Grid computing is seen as the forerunner of cloud computing, although the focus is more on scientific projects and the system is decentralized, i.e. shared. In contrast to grid computing, cloud computing is, from a first perspective, a centralized solution. From a technical point of view, however, and depending on how a cloud service is used by the user, cloud resources can be globally distributed and must communicate with each other in a network for this purpose. This in turn is similar to the approach of grid computing, since a corresponding coordination of these distributed resources is necessary. The most important providers of cloud computing services are currently Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft with its Azure cloud platform, and Rackspace. <sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup></p><p>In practice, the following three abstraction or business models have become established for the provision of cloud services: <sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup></p><ul><li><strong>On-premise</strong>: On-premise means on the customer's own premises or locally on site. The customer is responsible for managing its own IT infrastructure, which it usually administers in its own data center and on its own hardware.</li><li><strong>PaaS</strong> <strong>- Platform as a Service</strong>: The maintenance and management of hardware, operating systems and runtime environments for computer programs is taken over by the cloud provider. The user focuses only on his applications. A typical example of PaaS is scalable SQL databases (structured query language).</li><li><strong>IaaS</strong> <strong>- Infrastructure as a Service</strong>: The entire infrastructure consisting of network, storage, server hardware and virtualization layer (see <a href=#container-management-systems rel>Container Management Systems</a>) is provided by the cloud provider. The user assumes responsibility for the upper layers such as the operating system and applications.</li><li><strong>SaaS</strong> <strong>- Software as a Service:</strong> In this model, the entire hardware and software infrastructure is offered and managed. The user thus has the option of directly using software services, such as web servers or e-mail, without any effort.</li></ul><p>The figure below shows a breakdown of the business models mentioned.

The various types of these usage models are defined below: <sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup></p><ul><li><strong>Private cloud</strong>: The English term "private" translates into German as "privat" and, in the context of cloud, stands for "not for the public". A company uses a private cloud in a secure environment such as its own internal network. This does not necessarily mean that the IT infrastructure used is the property of the company, as it can also be provided by third parties. Private merely clarifies that a company is the sole user of this model. This has the advantage that it retains control in terms of data protection, even if third-party providers such as Amazon or Microsoft manage private cloud environments.</li><li><strong>Public cloud</strong>: A public cloud provides access to abstracted IT infrastructures and services for a large number of users. Customers can use services and infrastructures via the Internet. Examples are file hosting services such as Google Drive from Google Inc. or Dropbox from Dropbox Inc.</li><li><strong>Hybrid cloud</strong>: A hybrid form of the two variants mentioned above is the hybrid cloud. Users are offered the option of processing business-critical data with a focus on data protection in private cloud environments. Non-sensitive data is made available in the public cloud using cloud services such as IaaS or PaaS on the Internet. Hybrid clouds offer a further advantage in that performance peaks occurring at short notice are compensated for by shifting services from the private to the public cloud. Hybrid clouds enable the gradual merging of public and private cloud services in order to be able to utilize existing infrastructure hardware for as long as possible.</li></ul><p><strong>Figure 6</strong> shows an overview of private, public and hybrid cloud environments and illustrates the relationship between a private and public network.

least 2-n servers, also called nodes. All nodes are connected to each
other via a local area network (LAN) and form a logical unit of a
supercomputer. Gregory Pfister defines a cluster as follows: <sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup></p><p><em>"A cluster is a type of parallel system that consists of
interconnected whole computers and is used as a single, unified
resource. &ldquo;</em> <sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup></p><p>Clusters are the approach to achieving high performance, high
reliability, or high throughput by using a collection of interconnected
computer systems. Depending on the type of setup, either all nodes are
active at the same time to increase computing power, or at least 1-n
node is passive so that it can stand in for a failed node in case of
failure. For data transmission, all servers are connected to each other
via at least two network connections to a network switch. Two network
connections are typical, since on the one hand the switch is excluded as
SPOF, and on the other hand to be able to realize a higher data
transfer. <sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup></p><p>With reference to the current Top 500 list of the world's fastest
computers, the term supercomputer is absolutely appropriate. It is clear
that several cluster systems are among the ten fastest computers in the
world. Computer clusters are used for three different tasks: providing
high availability, high performance computing and load balancing. <sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup></p><h4 id=shared-and-distributed-storage>Shared and distributed storage</h4><p>According to the von Neumann architecture, a computer has a shared
memory that contains both computer program instructions and data.
Parallel computers are divided into two variants in this respect,
systems with shared or distributed memory. Regardless of which variant
is used, all processors must always be able to exchange data and
instructions with each other. The memory access takes place via a
so-called interconnect, a connection network for the transfer of data
and commands. The interconnect in clusters is an important component for
exchanging and communicating data between management and load
distribution processes. <sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup></p><p>In systems with shared memory, all processors share a memory. The memory
is divided into fixed memory modules that form a uniform address space
that can be accessed by all processors. The von Neumann bottleneck comes
into play here, which means that the interconnect, in this case the data
and instruction bus, becomes the bottleneck between memory and
processor. Due to the sequential or step-by-step processing of program
instructions, only as many actions can be performed as the bus is
capable of. As soon as the speed of the bus is significantly lower than
the speed of the processors, the processors repeatedly have to wait. In
practice, the waiting time is circumvented by the use of buffer memories
(cache), which is located between the processor and the memory. This
ensures that program commands are available to the processor quickly and
directly. <sup id=fnref:27><a href=#fn:27 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>27</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image86.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image86.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image86.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Bauke & Mertens, 2006, p. 22); Cf.

connected via the interconnect.</p><p>Computer systems with distributed memory, on the other hand, have a
separate memory for each processor. In this case, a connection network
is required. As soon as a shared memory is dispensed with, the number of
processors can be increased without any problems. By using a distributed
memory, each processor gains the upper hand over its address space,
since it is allocated its own local memory. Similar to distributed
memory, communication takes place via an interconnect, which in this
case is a local network. The advantage of computer systems with
distributed memory is the increase in the number of processors, but the
disadvantage lies in the disproportion between computing and
communication performance, since the transport of data between CPU
(Central Processing Unit) and memory is much slower. The bottleneck is
not in the bus as with distributed memory, but in the local network.

the use of multi-core processors, the complexity and expense of the
electronics to be implemented increases. This consequently entails
higher costs. A single system with, for example, 128 multicore
processors is very expensive and is therefore out of the question for
massively parallel applications. It is far more cost-effective to
operate 128 PCs, for example, with the same hardware, each with one
processor and distributed memory.</p><h4 id=message-passing-interface>Message Passing Interface</h4><p>Message Passing Interfaces (MPI) is a standardized and portable message
passing standard for message transmission between cluster nodes with
distributed memory (see <strong>Figure 9</strong>). This concept was developed by a
group of researchers from academia and industry to enable the
development of a variety of parallel computing architectures. The
standard defines syntax and semantics that are useful to a wide variety
of users. It is not a standardized protocol, but acts as a programming
interface for serial code used by the C and Fortran programming
languages. MPI is the most widely used model for parallel and concurrent
programming today. Currently used MPI implementations are MPI/Pro and
Local Area Multiprocessor (LAM) MPI. Both implementations are now fixed
components of Linux distributions. Another message-based model is the
Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) platform. This allows several computers
with a Windows or Linux operating system to be combined to form a
parallel system with distributed memory. <sup id=fnref:29><a href=#fn:29 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>29</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1031.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1031.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1031.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Bauke & Mertens, 2006, p. 45)  Figure 9: Message transmission between cluster nodes via the interconnect.</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=media/image1031.png data-srcset="/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1031.png, media/image1031.png 1.5x, /conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1031.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1031.png></a><figcaption class=image-caption>Source: Own representation based on (Bauke & Mertens, 2006, p. 45)<br><strong>Figure 9</strong>: <em>Message transmission between cluster nodes via the interconnect.</em></figcaption></figure><h4 id=high-availibility-cluster>High-Availibility Cluster</h4><p>There are many different application scenarios for clusters.

avoiding one or more single points of failure. In a cluster, a specific
system component is defined as SPOF as soon as it is designed as
non-redundant. A failover cluster is a group of servers configured so
that if one or more servers fail, another server automatically takes
over their service and continues processing. Each server in the cluster
has at least one other teammate, which functions as a so-called standby
server or partner server. The simplest variant of an HA cluster is
usually found in the 2-node solution, which is either symmetrically or
asymmetrically structured, depending on the architecture. An
asymmetrically structured cluster is an active/passive cluster, i.e. as
soon as one of the nodes has a fault, its passive partner node steps in
and takes over its services and function. A symmetrical active/active
cluster, on the other hand, keeps both server nodes active. In this
case, various services are shared between the two nodes for load
balancing. In this case, high availability and load balancing are
provided at the same time.</p><p>If one of the nodes fails, the active partner takes over its services
and the cluster remains available, not highly available but still in a
running mode. <sup id=fnref:30><a href=#fn:30 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>30</a></sup></p><p>For a standby server to be able to step in as an active server at all,
it must use a certain technique to determine that its active partner
server is no longer functioning. This is usually done by a so-called
heartbeat mechanism. This typically runs as a service on both server
nodes. The communication between the services runs over a local,
dedicated as well as redundant network. They communicate with each other
and check each other for signs of life - their heartbeat. As soon as
there are more than 2 nodes in a cluster, they also monitor each other
using various heartbeat techniques. Using push heartbeat, active servers
send signals to their respective standby servers at a fixed interval. If
one of the standby servers no longer receives a signal, it assumes that
its partner has failed and takes over the active role. Based on a pull
heartbeat, the standby server sends a certain number of requests to its
active partner. If the limit of these requests is reached without a
valid response from its partner, the partner takes over its services and
thus assumes the active part. <sup id=fnref:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup></p><h4 id=high-performance-computing-cluster>High-Performance Computing Cluster</h4><p>The goal of HPC clusters is to process complex computing tasks or
simulation applications, in parallel on all cluster nodes. The
combination of all cluster nodes thus results in immensely high
computing power. All nodes must consist of homogeneous or similar
hardware components in order to simplify the administration effort and
maintenance and to be able to handle error sources more easily.
Furthermore, all nodes are connected to each other via a local network
and usually access a common data storage. As soon as an application
falls into one of the following categories, increased requirements are
placed on memory, network and processors:</p><ul><li>computing-intensive applications</li><li>memory-intensive applications</li><li>communication-intensive applications</li></ul><p>Because of this, these types of clusters must provide high resilience,
high availability, and high redundancy.</p><p>The use of high-performance clusters, takes place in particularly
computationally intensive applications, which are often used in the
scientific field. <sup id=fnref:32><a href=#fn:32 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>32</a></sup></p><p><strong>Figure 11</strong> shows a typical architecture of an HPC cluster. All compute
nodes, also called working nodes, are connected via a local network by
means of a switch. In addition, there is a so-called shared storage.
This should not be confused with shared memory, which is only used in
processor systems (see <a href=#shared-and-distributed-storage rel>Shared and distributed Storage</a>). Shared storage is used for the joint and simultaneous access and exchange or intermediate storage of data, such as specially required application data or databases. Master nodes or front-end nodes form the central work platform for users, on which they can log in via a console terminal and interact with the cluster. Computing jobs are initiated and applications installed via this platform. <sup id=fnref:33><a href=#fn:33 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>33</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1220.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1220.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1220.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Bauke & Mertens, 2006, p. 52)   Figure 11: Typical construct of an HPC cluster.</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=media/image1220.png data-srcset="/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1220.png, media/image1220.png 1.5x, /conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1220.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1220.png></a><figcaption class=image-caption>Source: Own representation based on (Bauke & Mertens, 2006, p. 52)<br><strong>Figure 11</strong>: <em>Typical construct of an HPC cluster.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first multiprocessor clusters trimmed to high-performance computing,
such as the VAX-11/780, came onto the market in 1977 under the name
VAXCluster or VMSCluster. The technology pioneer at that time was
Hewlett-Packard (HP), then under the company name Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC). VAX stands for Virtual Address eXtension and, in
conjunction with the OpenVMS(virtual memory system) operating system
specially developed for this purpose, was a powerful tool in terms of
security, stability and low downtimes. Another notable example of an HPC
cluster that focuses more on low-cost high-performance computing is a
Beowulf cluster, which we will discuss in more detail in section <a href=#high-performance-computing-cluster rel>High-Performance Computing Cluster</a>. <sup id=fnref:34><a href=#fn:34 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>34</a></sup></p><h4 id=load-balanced-cluster>Load-Balanced Cluster</h4><p>Processing large amounts of data can lead to high loads on individual
nodes and must be managed. Server nodes have limited CPU, memory or
network capacity and cannot handle all loads on their own. Furthermore,
certain applications can only use or rely on a certain number of
processors. A load-balanced cluster is a computer network optimized for
load distribution. By distributing the data volumes over several
identical computers, the system is protected against total failures.
Likewise, the function of uniform performance availability is maintained
as capacity or computational requirements change during operation.

these various distribution algorithms:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Round-Robin algorithm</strong>: All computational requests and loads are
distributed evenly to each server, regardless of the current number

the servers in the cluster have equal processing capabilities based

they can handle, while others will consume only a portion of their

into account the different processing capabilities of each server.
Users manually assign a performance weight to each server, and a
scheduling sequence is automatically generated depending on the

across multiple computers to create a low-cost, high-performance
supercomputer. The name Beowulf, translated into German, means werewolf
and, in this context, comes from an Old English heroic poem and has
since stood as a meaningful emblem of the power such a cluster can
deliver. The first clusters of this type were developed in 1994 by
scientists Thomas Sterling, Donald Becker and Phil Merkey to support the
Earth and Space Sciences Project (ESS) at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA). <sup id=fnref:36><a href=#fn:36 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>36</a></sup></p><p>A Beowulf Cluster in practice is typically a collection of generic
computers, either commodity PCs or larger server systems, that are
independently procured, assembled, and connected via an internal
network. A Beowulf cluster consists of two types of computers, a main
(master) computer and multiple computer nodes. When a complex problem or
large data set is given to a Beowulf cluster, the master computer first
runs a program that breaks the problem into small pieces and sends one
piece at a time to each node to compute. When the nodes finish their
tasks, the master continuously sends more pieces to them until the
entire problem is solved. <sup id=fnref:37><a href=#fn:37 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>37</a></sup></p><p>When Thomas Sterling and Donald J. Becker started up their cluster in
1994, it consisted of sixteen Linux PCs, each with 100 MHz Intel DX4
processors. The individual computers were connected via Ethernet for the
required data exchange. Several benchmark tests were performed, which
test the performance of computers by measuring the number of floating
point number calculations possible per second. The measurement is given
in Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS). The results of the
tests were surprising with 4.5 MegaFLOPS per node and 60 MegaFLOPS in
total. This corresponds to a speedup of 13.33 or an efficiency of 83%.
These results are impressive for the reason that this performance was
comparable to the supercomputers from IBM and Co. at the time. The
remarkable thing, however, is that this cluster was operated at only a
fraction of the cost of supercomputers. <sup id=fnref:38><a href=#fn:38 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>38</a></sup></p><p>The following figure shows a Beowulf cluster with 64 PC nodes, which was

Systems (see <a href=#container-management-systems rel>Container Management Systems</a>), we will look at the basic technology of
virtualization. This foundational technology is necessary for the
operation of container technologies like Docker. In computer science,
virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual, rather than actual,
version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage
device, or network resources. Virtualization refers to a technology in
which an application or an entire operating system is abstracted from
the actual underlying hardware. In connection with container
technologies, a well-known type of virtualization, we distinguish here
between two techniques of virtualization, hypervisor-based and
container-based virtualization. <sup id=fnref:39><a href=#fn:39 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>39</a></sup></p><h4 id=hypervisor-based-virtualization>Hypervisor-based virtualization</h4><p>A key application of virtualization technology is server virtualization,
which uses a software layer called a hypervisor to emulate hardware such
as memory, CPU, and networking. The guest OS, which normally interacts
with real hardware, implements this with a software emulation of that
hardware, and often the guest OS has no idea it is running on
virtualized hardware. The hypervisor decides which guest OS gets how
much memory, processor time and other resources from the host machine.
In this case, the host machine runs the host OS and the hypervisor. This
means each OS appears to have direct access to the processor and memory,
but the hypervisor actually controls the host processor and resources by
allocating what is needed by each OS. While the performance of this
virtual machine does not match the performance of the OS running on real
hardware, the concept of hypervisor-based virtualization works quite
well because most OSes and applications do not require full use of the
underlying hardware. This allows for greater flexibility, control and
isolation by eliminating dependency on a specific hardware platform.
Originally intended for server virtualization, the concept of
virtualization has expanded to applications, which is implemented using
isolated containers. <sup id=fnref:40><a href=#fn:40 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>40</a></sup></p><h4 id=container-based-virtualization>Container-based virtualization</h4><p>Container virtualization or container-based virtualization is a method
of virtualizing applications but also entire operating systems.
Containers in this sense are isolated partitions that are integrated
into the kernel of a host machine. In these isolated partitions,
multiple instances of applications can run without the need for an OS.
This means that the OS is virtualized, while the containers that run
inside the system have processes that have their own identity and are
thus isolated from another process in another container. Software
running in containers communicates directly with the host kernel and
must be executable on the operating system and CPU architecture on which
the host is running. By not emulating hardware and booting a complete
operating system, containers can be started in a few milliseconds and
are more efficient than traditional virtual machines. Container images
are typically smaller than virtual machine images because container
images do not need to contain device drivers or a core to run an
operating system. Because of the compactness of these application
containers, they find their predominant use in software development.
Developers do not have to set up their development machines by hand;
instead, they use pre-built container images. These images are memory
maps of entire application structures that can be arbitrarily moved back
and forth between different host machines, also called shipping. This is
one of the reasons why container-based virtualization has become
increasingly popular in recent years. <sup id=fnref:41><a href=#fn:41 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>41</a></sup></p><p>Examples of container platforms are Docker from Docker Inc. and rkt from
the developers of the CoreOS operating system, with Docker enjoying
increasing popularity in recent years. Compared to virtual machines,
Docker represents a simplified solution to virtualization. <sup id=fnref:42><a href=#fn:42 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>42</a></sup></p><p><strong>Figure 14</strong> shows the key difference between container-based and hypervisor-based virtualization.</p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1528.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1528.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1528.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Containers vs. virtual machines)  Figure 14: Comparison between hypervisor and container.</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=media/image1528.png data-srcset="/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1528.png, media/image1528.png 1.5x, /conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1528.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1528.png></a><figcaption class=image-caption>Source: Own representation based on (Containers vs. virtual machines)<br><strong>Figure 14</strong>: <em>Comparison between hypervisor and container.</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=container-management-systems>Container Management Systems</h3><p>As soon as several containers are to be distributed and run on a
parallel system such as a cluster, it is necessary to use a container
management system. Such a system manages, scales and automates the
deployment of application containers. Well-known open source systems are
Kubernetes from Google or Docker Swarm. Another very well-known
container manager worth mentioning is the OpenShift software from
Redhat, but we will not discuss it further in this paper. These cluster
management tools play an important role as soon as a cluster has to take
care of tasks such as load balancing and scaling. In the following, we
will introduce the first two container managers mentioned and explain
their structure and use with containers.</p><h4 id=docker-swarm>Docker Swarm</h4><p>Docker is an open standards platform for developing, packaging, and
running portable distributed applications. With Docker, developers and
system administrators can create, deliver, and run applications on any
platform, such as a PC, the cloud, or a virtual machine. Obtaining all
the necessary dependencies for a software application, including code,
runtime libraries, and system tools and libraries, is often a challenge
when developing and running an application.</p><p>Docker simplifies application development and execution by consolidating
all the required software for an application, including dependencies,
into a single software unit called a Docker image that can run on any
platform and environment. The Docker software, based on the Docker image
runs in an isolated environment called a Docker container, which
contains its own file system and environment variables. Docker
containers are isolated from each other and from the underlying
operating system. <sup id=fnref:43><a href=#fn:43 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>43</a></sup></p><p>One solution already integrated into Docker is Docker Swarm Mode. Docker
Swarm is a cluster manager for Docker containers. Swarm allows
administrators and developers to set up and manage a cluster consisting
of multiple Docker nodes as a single virtual system. Swarm mode is based
on Docker Engine, the layer between the operating system and container
images. Clustering is an important feature for container technology
because it creates a cooperative group of systems that provides
redundancy and enables failover when one or more nodes experience a
failure. A Docker Swarm Cluster provides users and developers the
ability to add or remove containers as compute requirements change. A
user or administrator controls a swarm through a swarm manager, which
orchestrates and deploys containers. <strong>Figure 15</strong> shows the schematic
structure and relationship between instances. <sup id=fnref:44><a href=#fn:44 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>44</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image169.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image169.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image169.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation.

Pi, developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, were originally
intended to promote computer science education in schools. Acronyms like
"RPi" or the abbreviation "RasPi" or "Pi" for the Raspberry Pi are
mostly common here. Like smartphones, single-board computers are
equipped with ARM processors (Advanced RISC Machines). Before the
development of ARM in 1983, there were mainly CISC and RISC processors
on the market. CISC stands for Complex Instruction Set Computer.
Processors with this architecture are characterized by extremely complex
instruction sets. Processors with RISC (Reduced Instruction Set
Computer) architectures, on the other hand, have a restricted
instruction set and therefore also operate with low power requirements.
The Pi's board is equipped with a system-on-a-chip (SoC, i.e.
single-chip system), which has the identifier BCM2837 from Broadcom. The
SoC consists of a 1.2 GHz ARM Cortex-A53 Quad Core CPU, a VideoCore IV
GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and 512 MB of RAM. It does not include a
built-in hard drive, but uses an SD card for booting and permanent data
storage. It has an Ethernet port based on the RJ45 standard for
connecting to a network, an HDMI port for connecting to a monitor or TV,
USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports for connecting a keyboard and mouse,
and a 3.5 mm jack for audio and video output. <sup id=fnref:50><a href=#fn:50 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>50</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1833.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1833.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1833.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Merkert, 2017, p. 12)  Figure 17: Illustration of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and its components.</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=media/image1833.png data-srcset="/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1833.png, media/image1833.png 1.5x, /conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1833.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image1833.png></a><figcaption class=image-caption>Source: Own representation based on (Merkert, 2017, p. 12)<br><strong>Figure 17</strong>: <em>Illustration of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and its components.</em></figcaption></figure><p>An average of 35 EUR is the price one pays for a Raspberry Pi, which

using Raspberry Pi single-board computers. Here, these mini-computers
form the basis for constructing a cost-effective and energy-efficient
cluster system. Inspired by Joshua Kiepert and his 32-node RPiCluster or
Nick Smith and his first design of a 5-node Raspberry Pi cluster, the
idea of further developing and improving certain components has emerged,
such as increasing the cooling performance by means of an optimized
airflow supply, adding and logically arranging further connection
possibilities and considering a modular expandability of the cluster. <sup id=fnref:52><a href=#fn:52 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>52</a></sup></p><h3 id=requirements>Requirements</h3><p>The main focus in the design of this Raspberry Pi cluster is on the
following requirement criteria:</p><ul><li>Cost Efficiency.</li><li>Energy efficiency.</li><li>Scalability.</li><li>Resilience.</li></ul><p>Further criteria are a visual and easy-to-read status and information
display of current system values, ideal cooling and optimization of the
airflow for the best possible removal of heat. Furthermore, the entire
design concept is fundamentally based on certain design requirements,
which we will discuss in more detail in the design decisions (see <a href=#design-decisions rel>Design decisions</a>).</p><h4 id=cost-and-energy-efficiency>Cost and energy efficiency</h4><p>The factors of cost and energy efficiency are paramount and
predominantly influence the conception and design. In order to keep the
acquisition costs as low as possible but still be able to offer
efficient computing power, Raspberry Pi single-board computers in
version 3 are to be installed. The use of unnecessary cable lengths or
heavy and expensive materials such as sheet steel or aluminum for the
housing should be avoided. In addition, a weight and further cost saving
is to be achieved by using plastic instead of steel screws.</p><p>The system should be reproducible at low cost and consume as little
power as possible. Energy consumption of less than 60 kilowatts per hour
is planned, which is comparatively equivalent to the average power
consumption of a commercially available light source such as an
incandescent lamp. Such low power consumption implies the portability
factor, which means that it should also be possible to use this cluster
on a mobile basis.</p><h4 id=scaling-and-resilience>Scaling and resilience</h4><p>Scaling is to be considered in this system in two respects. On the one
hand, the user should be given the option of connecting the entire
system with other clusters in order to be able to scale cluster-wise at
this level. Here we also speak of horizontal scaling. On the other hand,
it should be possible to scale vertically or node by node within a
cluster by adding or removing individual nodes. This is done either
automatically using cluster software or by physically adding or removing
further single-board computers. Due to the modular structure of the
cluster, the primary goal is to expand individual entire clusters, i.e.
vertical scaling.</p><p>In parallel to scaling, failover is an important player when it comes to
keeping the cluster alive. As soon as the cluster system scales on the
software side, all peripheral components must be designed and optimized
accordingly so as not to reach their physical limits, such as maximum
storage capacity or computing power. This also applies to components
such as the network distributor and the power supply unit. With the help
of organizational measures and the creation of technical redundancies,
this fail-safety is to be guaranteed. This is also referred to as system
availability.</p><h4 id=status-and-information-display>Status and information display</h4><p>For a direct perception of current system values such as host name,
system time, processor and case temperature, a visual information
display should be available in the form of a display. These important
and system-critical values should be immediately and directly readable
without the help of technical means, such as a keyboard or the
connection of an external monitor. Furthermore, this display should have
a backlight to be readable even in dark rooms or with little to no
light.</p><h4 id=cooling>Cooling</h4><p>Passive cooling and optimized case ventilation are important points that
have to be considered in the design. The advantage of passive cooling
should be used to save energy on the one hand and costs on the other.
Active cooling is nevertheless necessary to ensure the supply of cold
air and the removal of warm air. Likewise, a basic law of physics, the
so-called chimney effect, must not be lost sight of during further
planning. This states: warm air rises, cold air remains on the ground.</p><h4 id=air-flow-and-heat-dissipation>Air flow and heat dissipation</h4><p>The processors of the individual nodes and integrated circuit modules
(IC) or internal circuit modules of the individual peripheral
components develop a certain amount of heat during operation. For a
correspondingly good removal of this warm air and to avoid heat
accumulation inside the case, this should be done in several stages and
can only be ensured with the help of an active case fan:</p><ol><li><p>Absorption of cold outside air at the front and transport to the
passive cooling elements inside the housing.</p></li><li><p>Dissipation of heat from the surface of the components (CPU, IC)</p></li><li><p>Removal of heated air from the rear of the housing.</p></li></ol><p>The design of the case should be adapted accordingly so that the
supplied air flow can optimally flow into the case, include all
components in its air channel as far as possible and discharge warm air
from the passive cooling elements out of the case again at a suitable
point.</p><h4 id=connections>Connections</h4><p>Due to the compact design of the housing, planning and accommodating all
necessary connections poses a certain challenge. It is important to
avoid unnecessary cable lengths within the housing, to save space and to
ensure sufficient room for suitable air circulation. Connections should
therefore be located in the immediate vicinity of the components, as
should the connections of internal components such as power, network or
control cables. In addition, the following connections should be
available externally on the housing:</p><ul><li>1x current</li><li>2x network</li><li>1x HDMI</li><li>2x USB</li></ul><h4 id=modularity>Modularity</h4><p>The building block principle, also called modularity, is related to
future extensions or the connection of further cluster systems on a
modular basis. This means that it should be possible to combine several
cluster systems of the same type to form a larger cluster complex. The
prerequisite for this are interfaces. In this case, a second network
connection (see <a href=#connections rel>Connections</a>). Modularity is also a prerequisite for the
planned scalability of the overall system and is therefore considered an
important point.</p><h3 id=design-decisions>Design decisions</h3><p>The basic characteristics of this Raspberry Pi cluster are minimalism,
transparency and simplicity. Minimalism in architecture, be it in
building or model construction, is characterized by the reduction to
simple cubic forms. The goal is the formation of geometric and pure
forms, which is made possible with the help of transparent building
materials such as glass. Whereupon we come to the property transparency.
On the software side, transparency means that the user of this system
knows exactly how the cluster system works, how it scales or what
software is used. On the hardware side, it is clear which physical
components such as cables, network distributors or connectors are
connected to each other or whether systems emit visual signals.
Simplicity, on the other hand, stands for easy understanding of the
system. It should, at first glance, imply the usefulness of this system,
from the point of view of an ignorant as well as affine user.</p><h4 id=minimalism-and-transparency-cube>Minimalism and transparency: cube</h4><p>We decide on a compact and portable design in the form of a cube and
christen the system with the name PiCube. The Pi, as in Rasperry Pi,
stands for Python Interpreter and signals that this system supports the
Python programming language or is generally supported by all common
operating systems like Raspbian or CoreOS. Python convinces with its
minimalistic and easily understandable programming style and also
contributes to the overall concept of this system. The English word Cube
means cube. Another idea for the naming is PiKube, where Kube stands for
the cluster management system used and at the same time comes from
Kubus, the ancient Greek kybos or the Latin cubus for cube. However,
since the design of the cube case does not have exactly equal faces, we
decide to use PiCube, since a cube is a regular hexahedron. A hexahedron
has six faces of equal size.</p><h4 id=simplicity-elastic-clip-concept>Simplicity: Elastic Clip Concept</h4><p>In order to allow easy assembly and reassembly, without the use of
additional tools or fastening screws of any kind, the Elastic Clip
concept by Patrick Fenner was used. This concept allows to create a slim
and elegant design. For this purpose, we use acrylic glass, which is
transparent, light and flexible, as the construction material for the
housing. The clips give the possibility to connect the single acrylic
glass sides of the cube in a 90 degree angle. The real highlight here is
the automatic snap-in of the clip connections in the insertion openings
provided for this purpose. Removal or dismantling of the cube walls is
done by bending the clip, so that the connections can be released. <sup id=fnref:53><a href=#fn:53 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>53</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image2023.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image2023.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image2023.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Laser-Cut Elastic-Clips, 2017)  Figure 19: Illustration of clip dimensions with and without force application.</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=media/image2023.png data-srcset="/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image2023.png, media/image2023.png 1.5x, /conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image2023.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image2023.png></a><figcaption class=image-caption>Source: Own representation based on (Laser-Cut Elastic-Clips, 2017)<br><strong>Figure 19</strong>: <em>Illustration of clip dimensions with and without force application.</em></figcaption></figure><p>$F$ stands for the force applied to the clip. The clip dimensions are:</p><p>$a$ = 4mm, $b$ = 2m, $d$ = 2mm, $l$ = 25mm</p><p>Depending on the nature, flexibility and material of the acrylic glass
used, the clip may break if too much force is applied. The problem is
that the maximum force is applied to the upper right $F$ on the upper
right end of the clip, which will break if it is too short. $l$ the clip
breaks if it is bent too much or subjected to too much load. To
counteract this, there is a simple way to distribute the load on the
clip at maximum force by widening the cut. This reduces the risk of the
clip breaking. <sup id=fnref:54><a href=#fn:54 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>54</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image213.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image213.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image213.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation based on (Laser-Cut Elastic-Clips, 2017)  Figure 20: Widening the incision site increases durability.</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=media/image213.png data-srcset="/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image213.png, media/image213.png 1.5x, /conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image213.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image213.png></a><figcaption class=image-caption>Source: Own representation based on (Laser-Cut Elastic-Clips, 2017)<br><strong>Figure 20</strong>: <em>Widening the incision site increases durability.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the material nature and flexibility of acrylic glass, the use of
this elastic clip concept is most suitable. If other materials such as
medium-density fiberboard (MDF) or simple wood are considered, it must
be noted here that due to the unidirectional or one-sided wood fibers,
much weaker resistance and thus less flexibility is offered to bend the
clip elastically. Use in conjunction with MDF is an alternative, but the
clip will inevitably break under too much load.</p><h3 id=picube>PiCube</h3><h4 id=2d-model-and-logo>2D model and logo</h4><p>Inkscape is a professional software for editing two-dimensional (2D)

inserted, rotated or scaled in size. Due to the exact specification of
the dimensions of the individual components, a correspondingly realistic

obtained from various suppliers or mail-order companies such as Amazon

Andreas Gregori from MAD Modelle Architektur Design. For the production
of the case we do not use laser cutting, but normal milling. This has
the advantage that we avoid traces of smoke or sclerosis, which occur
during laser cutting due to high temperatures. Milling has another
advantage and that is the possibility of surface milling. Thus, we are
able to engrave the PiCube logo (see <strong>Figures 21 and 24</strong>) into the upper

largest part of the costs, amounting to 246.75 EUR. The middle part of
the costs, which ranges between 13.75 and 22.99 EUR, is taken up by
the Gigabit switch, the USB charger and the USB cables. The rest of the
hardware, such as the LCD display, cables and plastic screws, are in the

the cluster on your own.</p><h3 id=mounting-and-wiring>Mounting and wiring</h3><p>Elastic clips (see <a href=#simplicity-elastic-clip-concept rel>Simplicity</a>) allow the individual case sides to be easily
plugged together without the use of screws. The pre-milled holes for the
switch, USB charger and LCD display allow the individual components to
be attached using the plastic nuts and screws. Pre-milled holes for the
LCD display, network ports, HDMI port, and power connector provide the
proper slots for the cables to be subsequently connected outside of the
case. The assembly is done according to the steps mentioned below:</p><ol><li>Connecting the single board computers together using hex spacers.</li><li>Screw on the attached Raspberry Pis on the left inner side.</li><li>Attachment of the switch to the base plate.</li><li>Attaching the LCD display and USB sockets to the front panel.</li><li>Screwing the USB charger to the right side plate.</li><li>Mounting the case fan, HDMI and network jacks.</li></ol><p>After the entire interior has been assembled, the side panels are
clipped in step by step. To do this, start with the base plate, onto
which the left and right side plates are clipped and clipped together.
Before assembling the front panel, we wire the individual components.
LCD displays only work by being powered and controlled. A total of 4
cable jumpers are used for this purpose. Two of them are for power and
the other two are for control and transmission signals which we connect
to GPIO pins 2, 3, 5 and 6 of one of the Raspberry Pis which acts as a
master node. All mini computers are connected to the switch using RJ45
network cables. Likewise, we connect the cables of the network jacks to
the switch, which serve as network port extensions. Micro-USB cables are
typically used for data transfer, in this scenario they are only used
for powering the individual single-board computers.</p><p>We connect the network switch and all Raspberry Pis to the USB charger
using the USB cables. We connect the case fan with its 3-pin connector
to the GPIO ports 2 and 6 of one of the Raspberry Pis to supply it with
power. After all the necessary cables and components are connected, we
move on to the cluster installation. The following two images show the
PiCube in a partially and fully wired state.</p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/picube4.jpg title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/picube4.jpg data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/picube4.jpg data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation.

use the HypriotOS operating system as the base system for the cluster.
The OS provides a Docker-optimized Linux kernel and is therefore ideally
suited for this cluster. It already includes all the required modules
such as Docker Engine, Docker Machine and Docker Compose. HypriotOS is
an operating system specially developed for Raspbery Pi, which is based
on the Linux distribution Debian. Important prerequisites for the
successful operation of a cluster system are identical and redundantly
designed hardware (see <a href=#cluster rel>Cluster</a>) and the cluster software that can run on it.
Among other things, this concerns the same software and driver versions
for all participating nodes. To ensure that the cluster system maintains
a homogeneous operating system and version structure on all nodes, we
use operating system images. <sup id=fnref:56><a href=#fn:56 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>56</a></sup></p><h4 id=imaging-and-provisioning>Imaging and provisioning</h4><p>For the installation of Raspberry Pi operating systems, memory images
are used. Images are disk images in a compressed file that contains
files, file system structures, and boot sectors. Simply put, an image
contains an exact disk copy of an operating system. The advantage of
using images is that an operating system does not have to be installed.
In order for this exact disk copy to be deployed in our nodes, we copy
the contents to SD cards and deploy them in our cluster nodes. Using the
Hypriot flash tool, the hostname is passed to the image and is thus
hardcoded for the first boot of the Raspberry Pi. Hardcoded means that
values, such as the hostname in this case, are passed into the startup
configuration of the operating system and are called and used when the
system starts. The following code snippet (see <strong>Listing 1</strong>) shows the
command that sets the hostname rpi1 for the image package

automatic provisioning. Due to the use of a total of 5 cluster nodes,
the manual installation, configuration and maintenance of each
individual node would be very time-consuming. Therefore, we provision
every single operating system in advance, which means we use a master
image that already contains current driver versions and software
packages. We modify this system image for each individual node by means
of a YAML configuration, so that only the host name has to be entered
and is thus hard-coded or hard-configured. As soon as the system starts,

application and verify the automatic scalability of the system: <sup id=fnref:59><a href=#fn:59 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>59</a></sup></p><p>For this purpose, a Docker image based on a simple web server
application is used. This Docker image contains a single web page, which
causes a maximum CPU load by simulated users when called. The Docker
image is launched, causing a web server to run with the corresponding
web page as a pod. Kubernetes' autoscaler is enabled with the following
configuration: <sup id=fnref:60><a href=#fn:60 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>60</a></sup></p><ul><li><p><strong>KUBE_AUTOSCALER_MIN_NODES = 1</strong>: The minimum number of nodes to be

the number of pods to the load, by enabling the cluster autoscaler.</p><p>Automatic and dynamic scaling can also be very helpful when there are
irregularities in cluster utilization. For example, development-related
clusters or continuous computing operations can be run on weekends or at
night. Compute-intensive applications can be better scheduled so that a
cluster is optimally utilized. In all cases, the cluster can be used
optimally. Either reduce the number of unused nodes to save energy or
scale to the limit to provide enough computing power. Depending on which
case occurs, a dynamically scaling cluster ensures that at high or low
utilization, all tasks are solved in the most efficient way.</p><h3 id=fail-safe>Fail-safe</h3><p>As with each element of our cluster, we ensure that more than one
instance of each component is running simultaneously. Setting the number
to five physical nodes per enclosure is one reason for creating the
possibility of optimal scaling and appropriate resilience. The greater
the number of nodes, the less likely there is to be a total failure or
bottleneck in scaling capabilities. Load balancing and availability are
closely related to cluster resilience. One way to ensure that a master
node is highly available is to allow a worker node to step in as master.
Kubernetes already inherently brings the function that as soon as a
master node fails, a worker takes its place. The active/passive design
is already in use. Second, this failover implementation is active for
all worker nodes. <strong>Figure 28</strong> shows how load balancing and failover work
together to keep this cluster alive in the event of a master as well as
worker node failure. The actors here are the cluster components etcd,
kube-apiserver, kube-controller and kube-scheduler (see <a href=#google-kubernetes rel>Google Kubernetes</a>). The
Kubernetes API server, controller, and scheduler all run inside
Kubernetes as pods. This means that in the event of a failure, each of
these pods will be moved to a different node, thus preserving the core
services of the cluster. Here, one considers potential failure
scenarios:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Loss of the master node</strong>: If not configured for HA, loss of the
master node or its services will have a severe impact on the
application. The cluster will not be able to respond to commands or
deploy nodes. Each service in the master node is critical and is
configured appropriately for HA, so a worker node automatically
steps in as the master.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loss of worker nodes</strong>: Kubernetes is able to automatically detect
and repair pods. Depending on how the services are balanced, there
may be an impact on the end users of the application. If any pods on
a node are not responding, kubelet detects this and informs the
master to use a different pod.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network failure</strong>: The master and worker nodes in a Kubernetes
cluster can become unreachable due to network failures. In some
cases, they are treated as node failures. In this case, other nodes
are used accordingly to replace the respective node that is
unreachable.</p></li></ul><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3211.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3211.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3211.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation.

of one or more master nodes and up to four worker nodes. This is
critical for running development or production environments in
Kubernetes. An odd number of nodes is chosen so that it is possible to
keep the cluster alive even with only one node. A cluster node can
continue to operate in the last instance once a node is only acting as a
master and worker. In this state, the cluster is neither highly
available, fail-safe, nor completely resilient, but it survives.</p><h3 id=cost-efficiency-and-performance>Cost efficiency and performance</h3><p>Looking at the costs, there are two sides to the story. With the total
acquisition costs, minus the contributed effort to assemble, install and
configure the cluster, the value of the investment is exactly 358.79
EUR. This construct is contrasted with a simple Linux cluster for
comparison. This Linux cluster consists of commercially available PCs
with comparable core data to that of the Raspberry Pi nodes.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left></th><th style=text-align:left><strong>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</strong></th><th style=text-align:left><strong>Linux PC</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>CPU</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Cortex-A53 1.2 GHz Quadcore</td><td style=text-align:left>Intel Celeron J1900 2 GHz Quadcore</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>RAM</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>1024 MB</td><td style=text-align:left>4 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Network</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>100 Mbps</td><td style=text-align:left>1000 Mbps</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Current Consumption</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>max. 4 Watt / h</td><td style=text-align:left>max. 10 Watt / h</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Price per computer</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>approx. 35 €</td><td style=text-align:left>approx. 95 €</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Total price</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>approx. 175 €</td><td style=text-align:left>approx. 475 €</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table 2</strong>: <em>Cost comparison of the core components of Raspberry Pi and Linux PC.</em></p><p>If we now compare the core data, we can see that the comparison system
is definitely associated with higher acquisition costs. It is important
to mention that this comparison primarily focuses on the costs and not
the performance of the individual systems. It is obvious that a Linux
PC, based on a CISC processor architecture, definitely achieves higher
FLOPS than an ordinary ARM processor. Nevertheless, it becomes clear in
the first approach that, despite the lower performance, there is a
significant difference in terms of cost. Especially when performance per
watt is calculated. Due to the compact design of the Raspberry Pi and
the accommodation of all components, such as the integrated power supply
and GPU, it is a competitive partner for the Linux PC.</p><p>In relation to the costs, the question arises how the comparison systems
perform in terms of performance. For this, a performance test is
performed with the help of sysbench. Sysbench is a benchmark application
that quickly gives an impression of the system performance. For this
purpose, a CPU benchmark is run on both systems, which calculates all
prime numbers up to 20000, and the results are shown in <strong>Table 3</strong> and <strong>Figure 31</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left></th><th style=text-align:left><strong>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</strong></th><th style=text-align:left><strong>Linux PC</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>CPU benchmark</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>Prime number calulation</td><td style=text-align:left>Prime number calculation</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Threads (process parts)</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>4</td><td style=text-align:left>4</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Limit</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>20000</td><td style=text-align:left>20000</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><strong>Calculation time</strong></td><td style=text-align:left>115.1536 seconds</td><td style=text-align:left>11.2800 seconds</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table</strong> <strong>3</strong>: <em>Comparison times of the prime number calculation up to 20000.</em></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3324.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3324.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3324.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation.

is also taken into account. Although this is low, it increases
constantly with the number of nodes installed in the case. The heat
development is about 35 degrees Celsius with an average load of a single
board. With 5 nodes, this is already around 38 degrees, which
corresponds to a factor of around 1.08 per node. If all 5 nodes are
overclocked by increasing the processor's clock frequency, this factor
increases to 1.1. Temperature differences of 10 degrees in the case and
the processor prove that the maximum performance of all hardware nodes
cannot be exploited without appropriate cooling. Passive heat sinks and
an already implemented active cooling with the help of a case fan can
help here. There is no question that the optimized airflow inside the
case also contributes to the improved cooling performance.</p><h3 id=use-case-setihome>Use Case SETI@home</h3><p>After evaluating the cluster, we turn to a use case from the scientific
domain. A current PRC project of BOINC is SETI@home, a scientific
experiment run by the University of California at Berkeley that uses
computers connected to the Internet in the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence. One participates by running a free client program on a
computer that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data. This project
relies on the concept of grid computing. Data sets to be processed are
divided into smaller data sets and distributed to all participating
clients, who compute and communicate the results to the distributor,
which reassembles the computations into an overall data set. The current
computing power of the entire BOINC grid is 20600 PetaFLOPS, distributed
over nearly 0.9 million computers. SETI@home has a share of about 19.1%
of this. <sup id=fnref:62><a href=#fn:62 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>62</a></sup></p><p>In the following, container virtualization is exploited and pre-built
BOINC client images of Docker are used. These images are prefabricated
containers, which are started as scalable pods on the PiCube and scale
automatically in order to utilize the entire computing power of the
cluster. To do this, you register with the SETI@home project and create
an account. Using this account data, you generate a container
application called k8s-boinc-demo and start it on the cluster with a
scaling limit of 10 pod instances. In <strong>Figure 32</strong>, you can see from the
Kubernetes dashboard how the pods are distributed evenly or according to
workload across worker nodes rpi2 to rpi5 after launch. <sup id=fnref:63><a href=#fn:63 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>63</a></sup></p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3712.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3712.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3712.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation.

pods are utilized. The CPU utilization is left at the default value of
100% and after about 5 minutes you can see how the CPU utilization of
all cluster nodes increases to 100% and remains constant at this value
(see <strong>Figure 33</strong>). The cluster now computes data of the SETI@home project.</p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3822.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3822.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3822.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: Own representation.

account information. Each pod is identified here as a single client. If
we now assume that the number of PiCube clusters increases to ten, the
number of pods would multiply by the same factor. With 10 pod instances
per cluster, this means 100 active SETI@home clients, which could make
their computing power available to the BOINC grid.</p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3932.png title=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3932.png data-thumbnail=/conception-construction-and-evaluation-of-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/media/image3932.png data-sub-html="<h2>Source: (SETI@home - Your Computers, 2018).

of this cluster is without question. Using dynamic pod scaling, it is
demonstrated that even when individual nodes have low performance, they
can achieve high computing performance when combined as a swarm.
BOINC's computing grid is a typical example of how computers,
distributed around the world and connected via the Internet, can solve
problems together.</p><h2 id=conclusion-and-outlook>Conclusion and outlook</h2><p>It is possible to construct a comparable system of a supercomputer with
low costs. It is obvious that the performance of an ARM processor cannot
currently keep up with commercially available CISC processors, as
described in <a href=#cost-efficiency-and-performance rel>Cost efficiency and performance</a>. However, the use case and illustration of dynamic
scaling show that once distributed systems are interconnected, they
develop very high parallel computing power. The Raspberry Pi cluster
provides an interesting approach to perform tests or use cases in
research, education, and academia. ARM architectures are evolving
rapidly in terms of performance and efficiency over the next few years,
with power consumption always in mind. The requirements set at the
beginning of this thesis, such as energy efficiency, resilience and
modularity, have been met and sensibly implemented in the construct.
There is no question that this PiCube cluster is not a real competitor
to massively parallelized supercomputers, but the decisive approach lies
in the benefit of a computing grid.</p><p>There are several ways to use this system in the future. On the one
hand, its simplicity means it can be used for cluster computing to
provide a small, full-featured, low-cost, energy-efficient development
platform. This includes understanding its limitations in terms of
performance, usability and maintainability. On the other hand, it can
act as a mobile and self-sufficient <strong>cloud in a box</strong> system by adding
components such as solar cells and mobile connectivity. Either way, it
will remain a fascinating project that offers developers many
possibilities and gives a <strong>think-out-of-the-box</strong> approach.</p><h2 id=bibliography>Bibliography</h2><p>Adams, J. (September 2017).
