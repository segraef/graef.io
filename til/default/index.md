John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible.
> The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text,
> without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
> While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters,
> the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.
